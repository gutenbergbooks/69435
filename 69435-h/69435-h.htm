</div>

<p>The benediction of God was in the sunshine
that lay still and bright upon green fields and
blooming gardens. The town, marshaled along
the river side, nestled quietly under the caressing
warmth. Down by the steamboat landing it
stirred into sudden noisy activity as the up-river
boat drew in and made ready to discharge cargo
and passengers. But farther back, where the
streets, lined with maple and butternut trees and
white-blossomed locusts, climbed the long sloping
hill, the May sunshine seemed to have kissed the
earth into radiant peace. Here and there, from
some white-painted cottage set in a grassy, tree-shaded
yard, came the sound of a woman’s voice
in speech or song, or the shrilly sweet accents of
children at play floated out from porch or shady
nook.</p>

<p>The lilac bushes in a yard at the top of the hill,
hedging the walk from front door to gate, lazily
stirred their lavender foam and sent forth waves
of fragrance. The house, uncompromisingly
white and square and solid-looking, with green
shutters at the windows, had a wide, columned
veranda across the southward front and down the
eastern side. Upon the balmy stillness in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
it too was enveloped there came a sound of dancing
steps and girlish laughter, and a young woman
ran out of the front door, teasing with a leafy
switch a gray kitten that scampered at her side.
Her spreading skirts, crinolined and beruffled,
tilted back and forth, and with a sudden twist she
caught the kitten within their cage. As it peeked
out, with a half-frightened face, ready to spring
away, she caught it by the back of the neck and
lifted it to the bend of her arm.</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t, Prince of Walesy!” she
laughed. “You’re not smart enough yet to get
away from me like that!” Leaning against the
veranda rail she gazed watchfully down the street
while she pinched the kitten’s ears until it squeaked
and then stroked it into purring content. The
sunlight brought out reddish and golden gleams
in her dark brown hair.</p>

<p>“Walesy, why don’t they come!” she exclaimed
with an impatient frown, pulling the cat’s tail
while it protested with growl and claw. “I heard
the steamboat a long time ago.” Her eyes
sought the glimpses of sparkling river between
the trees and she descried a thin banner of smoke
moving up-stream. “Yes, there it goes! They’ll
surely be here soon! Now don’t make such a fuss
about having your tail pulled. You’ll just have
to get used to it!”</p>

<p>She began to whistle softly, stopped, cast a
backward glance at the open door, made a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
grimace and struck again into her tune, louder
than before. Up the street, under the drooping
white masses of locust bloom, came a two-seated
carriage. “Mother! They’re coming! They’re
right here!” she called. Then with the kitten
still in her arm she scurried down the path between
the walls of fragrant lilac, her crinolined
skirt giving glimpses of trimly slippered feet as
it tilted from side to side. Unlatching the gate
she stepped upon its lower cross-piece and swung
back upon it as far as it would go. “Father!
Rhoda!” she called out joyously, and was herself
welcomed with “Well, Charlotte!” and a kiss by
her father and a laughing embrace by her sister.
One of the tall, square gate-posts bore the sign,
“Dr. Amos M. Ware.”</p>

<p>“Now let’s take in the things!” cried Charlotte.
“I’m just dying to see what you’ve brought!
Here, Jim,” to the negro who was holding the
horses, “come and carry in these bundles.”</p>

<p>Within the house there was eager cross-fire of
question and answer, punctuated by frequent exclamations
of delight, as the two sisters and their
mother unwrapped the parcels and examined
their contents.</p>

<p>“This is for mother,” said Rhoda, shaking out
a light wool wrap. “They’re wearing these little
shawls so much this spring. Charlotte, doesn’t
she look nice in it!” Throwing her arms around
her mother’s shoulders Rhoda kissed her twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and then rushed back to the table piled with packages.
“And I’ve got the sweetest bonnet for
you, Charlotte!” she went on, opening a bandbox.
“There! isn’t that lovely, mother?” She tied the
strings under Charlotte’s chin and all three clustered
about the mirror as the girl critically surveyed
herself therein.</p>

<p>The bonnet covered her head, in the fashion of
the days “before the war,” and the wreath of
flowers inside its front made a dainty frame that
seemed to be trying to compel into demureness
the saucy face with its tip-tilted nose and mischievous
brown eyes.</p>

<p>The two sisters, reflected side by side in the
mirror, looked oddly unlike. Charlotte’s deep
tones of hair and eyes and rich coloring paled in
her elder sister into light brown and gray, and
faint rose-bloom upon her cheek. But Rhoda’s
straight, thin-nostriled nose gave to her countenance
a certain dignity which the other’s lacked,
while her mouth, with its curved upper lip, just
short enough to part easily from its full red fellow,
had a piquant sweetness more attractive than
her sister’s more regular features. Her eyes,
large and gray, and indeed all the upper part of
her face, had a serious expression. At the corners
of her mouth there was just the suggestion of an
upward turn, like that in the Mona Lisa. It gave
to the lower part of her face an expression curiously
contradictory of the grave upper part, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
sense of the joyousness of life were always hovering
there and ready at any moment to break forth
in laughter. When she did smile there was a
sudden irradiation of her whole countenance. The
short upper lip lifted above white teeth, the faint
upward curve at the corners of her mouth deepened
and her eyes twinkled gaily. But no one
ever accounted Rhoda so handsome as her younger
sister. Even those who admired her most thought
her forehead too high and her cheek bones too
prominent for beauty.</p>

<p>“And this muslin is for a dress for you, Charlotte,”
Rhoda went on, holding it up for their
inspection. “Isn’t this vine a lovely pattern,
mother? We must make it with three wide
flounces, from the foot to the waist, and the skirt
even wider than these we’re wearing now. And
this white silk is to make a drawn bonnet for you,
mother. I saw several of them in Cincinnati—they’re
quite the latest thing. I have the pattern
and directions and I’m sure I can do it.”</p>

<p>There were only three of them, but as they
moved about in their big, balloon-like skirts,
examining, comparing, discussing the purchases,
they seemed to pervade the whole large room with
the essence of femininity and to fill it with their
bodily presence.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” said Charlotte, taking up a
small package. “It feels like a book.” And she
began to undo its wrappings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Rhoda looked, then half turned away. “It is
a book—one father bought for me. You won’t
care about it.”</p>

<p>Charlotte glanced at her curiously and with increased
interest went on with the unwrapping.
“Oh! ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin!’” she exclaimed disdainfully
as she tossed the book away. “What
do you want to read that for? Walesy, stop it!”
And with a backward jump and a downward
swoop she extricated the kitten from beneath her
hoopskirt, boxed its ears and then cuddled it in
her arm, whence in a moment more issued sounds
of distress and anger.</p>

<p>Her mother spoke reprovingly, in soft tones
that betrayed southern birth: “Charlotte, don’t
hurt the little thing! Do try to remember that
you’re grown up!”</p>

<p>The girl rubbed the kitten against her face and
cooed: “Well, it was its own Charlotte’s precious
Prince of Walesy kitty-cat and if it wants to say
that ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ is just a nasty old Black
Republican mess of lies it shall, so it shall! Shan’t
you, Walesy?”</p>

<p>The kitten’s vehement response, slyly inspired,
went unheeded as she turned again to her sister,
demanding, “What do you want to read it for,
Rhoda, when you know it’s just a lot of stuff with
no truth in it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that, Charlotte. I’ve wanted
to read it for a long time, because it’s talked about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
so much. And while we were in Cincinnati we
went to Levi Coffin’s, and they told us so much
about Mrs. Stowe, and how she got some of the
incidents for the story and talked such a lot about—the
darkies who—try to go to Canada that it
made me very anxious to read the book.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Levi Coffin?” asked Charlotte, regarding
her sister closely and noting a brief hesitation
as Rhoda carefully folded the white silk
before she replied: “Oh, just a friend of father’s.
They’re Quakers and they wouldn’t interest you.”</p>

<p>Charlotte reached for the book and turned its
leaves over carelessly. “Humph! If they’re
friends of Mrs. Stowe they’re probably just some
more nigger-stealers! You’ll soon be a black
abolitionist yourself, Rhoda, if you keep on. And
then we won’t associate with her, will we, Walesy!
Didn’t you meet any nice people?”</p>

<p>Rhoda paid no heed to her sister’s aggressive
tone. “Oh, yes! Mrs. Benjamin Harrison—Carrie
Scott, you know—she and I were such
good friends while I was at Dr. Scott’s Institute—happened
to be visiting in Cincinnati and she
and I had a long talk. And I saw several other
girls whom I knew at Dr. Scott’s. And—oh,
mother! You’ll be so pleased!” Her color
warmed and her face brightened as she went on.
“It was most romantic! We met Mr. Jefferson
Delavan!”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you! Where? How did it happen?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Tell me all about it!” Mrs. Ware’s eager questions
and delighted face showed how nearly the
information touched her heart. But Charlotte
merely demanded, with puzzled interest, “Who
is he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember, Charlotte?” Rhoda
went on. “His mother was Adeline Fairfax,
mother’s dear friend when they were girls together
in Virginia. My middle name is after her,
you know, and it’s her miniature that mother has
on her dressing table.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Charlotte. “It was at
her home that we visited, wasn’t it, a long time
ago, in Kentucky?”</p>

<p>“Yes—Fairmount, they call it. Such a beautiful
place, just beyond Lexington. Mother and
you and I visited there for a month, twelve years
ago, wasn’t it, mother, when we first came here to
Hillside. You were only six years old then, so
I suppose you don’t remember much about it.
But I remember it all very well and what a good
time we had.”</p>

<p>“Poor, dear Adeline!” Mrs. Ware was wiping
her eyes. “She and I did enjoy that visit so
much I And we never saw each other again, for
she died the next year. If she had lived you and
her children would have seen a great deal of each
other. But do tell me about Jeff, Rhoda! Where
did you see him? And how did he know who you
were? He was such a fine boy—about twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
years old, wasn’t he?—when we were there. Just
two years older than you, Rhoda. Did you meet
him in Cincinnati?”</p>

<p>“No. He was on the steamboat when we went
down and the captain—it was Captain Laidlaw,
father’s friend, you know—introduced him to us,
and then he remembered who we were and we
had great fun talking over the good times we had
at Fairmount.”</p>

<p>“Was his sister Emily with him? She was
named for me, you know. Is either of them
married yet?”</p>

<p>“No, she wasn’t with him, and neither one of
them is married. He told me his father’s sister
has lived with them ever since his mother died.
His father died too last year and now he manages
the plantation.”</p>

<p>“Is he handsome?” queried Charlotte.</p>

<p>“N—no, not exactly handsome. But very fine-looking,
and so courteous!”</p>

<p>“Then you saw more of him after you left the
steamboat?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He called on us in Cincinnati, and we
went out together several times and then it happened
that he finished his business there in time
to take the same steamboat back that we did.”</p>

<p>Charlotte regarded her sister with dancing
eyes. “Is he coming up here to visit—us?” she
demanded. Rhoda reddened under her scrutiny.
She did not always find it easy to keep her composure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
under Charlotte’s habit of making audacious
deductions and voicing reckless intuitions.
But she had learned long before that to betray
embarrassment was to invite more questioning.
She answered with apparent unconcern:</p>

<p>“Father asked him to come and told him how
pleased mother would be to see him, and he said
that he expected to be up near the river before
long and he would cross over and call on us.”</p>

<p>“Dear boy! Indeed, I shall be glad to see
him! Adeline’s son—how time does fly!”</p>

<p>“Does he own slaves?” said Charlotte, her eyes
still on her sister’s face.</p>

<p>“Of course!” replied Mrs. Ware. “You evidently
don’t remember the place, Charlotte. It is
a large tobacco plantation, and when we were there
Mr. Delavan had a great many slaves.”</p>

<p>Charlotte sprang to her feet and poised the
kitten on her shoulder. “Then you won’t like
him, Rhoda—and I shall!” Whistling merrily,
she took some dancing steps toward the door.</p>

<p>“Charlotte!” called her mother reprovingly,
“Do try to remember that you’re not a child any
more! I’ve told you so often it’s not ladylike to
whistle!”</p>

<p>Rhoda smiled at her fondly. “Don’t you
know, sister, what happens to whistling women
and crowing hens?”</p>

<p>“Oh fudge! That’s all nonsense. I heard a
better one the other day—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘Girls that whistle and hens that crow</div>
<div class="verse">Catch the pleasures as they go.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>There’s some truth in that! I’m going to show
father my new bonnet, and he doesn’t care if I do
whistle!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware gazed after her as she floated down
the veranda and disappeared around the corner
of the house, tilting her skirts and whistling.</p>

<p>“I did hope Charlotte wouldn’t be so trying
after she became a young lady!” she said in soft,
plaintive tones.</p>

<p>“Never mind, mother. She doesn’t really mean
to be trying. She does it just the same as she
pinches the kitten’s tail, to make it meaow. If
you don’t pay any attention to her she’ll quit much
sooner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware crossed the room to her daughter,
pressed an arm around her waist and kissed her
cheek. “I’m so glad you happened to meet Jeff
Delavan,” she murmured. “If he comes to see
us, and I’m sure he will—” she glanced at the
warmer color that flushed Rhoda’s face, smiled,
and went on, “What did you buy for yourself,
dear?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>“Father! Can these things be true? Oh, how
terrible it is! Do such things really happen now,
in this country?”</p>

<p>Rhoda Ware rushed into her father’s office, her
cheeks wet with recent tears, her voice vibrating
on the verge of sobs. Dr. Ware looked up from
the medical work he was reading in some surprise.
For it was unusual for her to give way, at least
in his presence, to so much agitation. His professional
eye took quick note of her excited nerves.
In the same glance he saw that she held a book
tightly grasped in her trembling hands and read
its title. But he did not betray in either words or
manner the fact that he had noticed it or the satisfaction
that it gave him.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Rhoda, and calm yourself,” he said
quietly. “What is it you want to know about?
Something you’ve been reading?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’ Father,
isn’t it exaggerated? Can it be true?”</p>

<p>Appeal sounded in her tones, the longing of a
sensitive nature to be assured that what it has
suffered in imagination no human being has been
called upon to suffer in the thousandfold of reality.
He noted her hurried breathing, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
catch of a half-sob in it now and then, and as he
looked into her appealing eyes the man and the
father in him drew back from saying what he
wished to say lest he add to her hurt and the
physician counseled not to increase her excitement.
But the believer in a cause urged him to strike
while the iron was hot. And it was the believer
that won, after a mere moment of hesitation.</p>

<p>“You heard what they said at Levi Coffin’s,
about many of the incidents of the book being
based on fact. But what you have read there is
only a drop in the bucket!”</p>

<p>As he leaned toward her across his desk and
she, seated at the other side, bent her face toward
him, even a casual observer might have seen their
relationship. For her countenance was a copy of
his, a young, soft, feminine copy, but yet formed
clearly upon the same plan, even in the details of
feature and coloring. His eyes, large and gray
like hers, were calm and cool and judicial in expression,
even when, as now, they were alight with
earnestness. His shaven upper lip, also, was
short, but it pressed upon the lower in a firm line,
while all his countenance expressed a sort of
austerity that seemed to bespeak a mind informed
with intense moral conviction rather than hardness
or coldness of nature. But looking at the
two faces thus, one could see in hers the kindling
fires of an emotionalism which would be forever
foreign to him, an incipient power of emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
exaltation which would never be within his possibilities.
But if there was less of warmth in his
eyes and of spirituality in his brow, poise and cool
judgment were written there, and far-sightedness,
their inevitable offspring. Of the intellectual,
judicial type Dr. Ware’s countenance showed him
to be, and however much or little of such qualities
his daughter had inherited from him, along
with her remarkable physical resemblance, from
elsewhere had come the emotional forces which
now were trembling in the sensitive curves of her
mouth and glowing in her tear-wet eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing in that book that couldn’t be
duplicated right now in the South, every day in
the week,” Dr. Ware was saying in low, even
tones that nevertheless held such intensity of conviction
that she felt her nerves thrilling with it.
“And even then, Rhoda, it’s only a beginning!
There are such horrors perpetrated under slavery
as a young girl like you can’t begin to realize!”</p>

<p>She shuddered, and he watched her silently as
she pressed her lips together and deliberately held
her breath for a moment in the effort to master
her emotion.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever quite realized anything
about it before,” she said in calmer voice, “although
I’ve always believed, ever since I’ve known
anything about it, that it is wrong. But I’ve
never felt, all through me”—and she shivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
again—“just how wrong it is, until this book has
made it seem all real and alive.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, leaning her arms upon the desk,
and a puzzled expression crossed her face. “But,
father,” she presently went on, “why doesn’t
mother feel as you do about it? Her father
owned slaves, and until she married you she had
always lived on the plantation with slaves all
around her. And she still thinks that slavery is
right and that the negroes are happier and better
off in it than they would be if they were free.
She’s so kind and gentle, how can she feel as she
does if this book is true?”</p>

<p>“Your mother and I, Rhoda, have never discussed
the question. Her father was a kindly
man and treated his slaves well, and so the only
conditions that she knew anything about were of
slavery at its best. She had such a happy girlhood
on her father’s plantation, where the slaves
were all eager to do anything for her, that her
memories of it are very pleasant. I’ve never
wanted to disturb them, because it wouldn’t do any
good and it might spoil the pleasure she takes in
thinking about those days; and so I’ve never
talked about it with her, although she knows, of
course, what I think.”</p>

<p>Rhoda threw him an admiring glance, which he,
with his eyes averted in semi-embarrassment at
having revealed a glimpse of his inner self to his
offspring, did not see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Mother has told us, Charlotte and me,” Rhoda
went on thoughtfully, “so many things about her
girlhood and her father’s plantation, and she has
always been so pleased in recalling those days, that
I couldn’t help wondering sometimes if anything
could be wrong that made everybody as happy as
they seemed to have been in her home. And
Charlotte, you know, is quite convinced that slavery
is all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlotte!” Dr. Ware exclaimed in an
amused tone. “She’s just a little fire-eater! But
she doesn’t mean half she says.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes she doesn’t, but she seems to be
getting quite in earnest about it lately.”</p>

<p>“Like all the rest of us, on both sides,” her
father appended.</p>

<p>“Mother says her father never sold a negro,”
Rhoda went on, “and that his slaves were always
contented and happy and that the same things were
true on the other plantations where she visited.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware’s face darkened. “He didn’t, while
he lived. But he left his affairs in such a tangle
when he died that most of his slaves were sold to
satisfy his debts. Your mother was ill then—it
was about the time you were born—and I did not
tell her, and as we were living in the North nobody
else did, anything about that part of it. To
this day she doesn’t know”—he was clipping off
his words in a tone of impersonal resentment—“that
her old mammy, of whom she was so fond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
was sold to a trader who was buying for a cotton
plantation in the South. When I found out about
it I tried to have her traced, so as to buy her myself,
bring her North and free her. But I finally
found that she was dead and that her fate, though
different, had been no better than Uncle Tom’s.”</p>

<p>The girl drew back with an exclamation of
horror, and her eyes filled. “Oh, father! That
good, kind creature, who loved mother so much!”</p>

<p>“Don’t ever tell your mother,” he cautioned.
“It would do no good and it would make her
unhappy. You see, Rhoda, how impossible it is
for one man, no matter how good his intentions
may be, to keep back the evil that is inherent in
slavery. He can’t make his own affairs better
than the system very long.”</p>

<p>Rhoda was looking out through the open door,
her brow puckered in a thoughtful frown, the
pain in her heart evidenced by the droop and the
quiver of her sensitive lips. Dr. Ware’s office
was on the eastern side of the house and faced a
gate, opening from the cross street, through which
a young man was now striding hastily.</p>

<p>“There’s Horace Hardaker!” she exclaimed.
“How excited he looks! Oh, do you suppose he’s
had bad news from Julia?”</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet and rushed out upon
the veranda. “Very likely,” her father answered.
“The border ruffians are overrunning eastern Kansas.
What is it, Horace? What has happened?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
he went on, grasping the young man’s
hand as he mounted the steps. They pressed close
to him, expectant, their faces anxious.</p>

<p>“Julia—have you had bad news?” Rhoda threw
in breathlessly.</p>

<p>Hardaker’s face was working with suppressed
excitement and it was a moment before he could
speak.</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard?” he broke out. “Oh, it’s
frightful! Senator Sumner was attacked yesterday
in the senate chamber and beaten almost to
death!”</p>

<p>“My God, Horace! Who did it?” cried Dr.
Ware, gripping the other’s hand, his face paling.</p>

<p>“Preston Brooks—”</p>

<p>“Of South Carolina—yes, go on!”</p>

<p>“Senator Butler’s nephew—that speech of Sumner’s
the other day—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! The crimes of the South! Brooks
has killed him?”</p>

<p>“No, but he may not live. Brooks came upon
him from behind, as he sat at his desk, and while
he was penned there pounded him over the head
with a heavy cane.”</p>

<p>“Will the North stand this insult?” Dr. Ware
exclaimed, dropping the other’s hand, which unconsciously
he had been gripping and shaking
during their colloquy. With quick steps and
short turns he marched this way and that as they
went on talking, running his fingers through his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hair until it stood upright. Rhoda shared in their
excitement, her nerves still tingling from her recent
emotion, mind and heart alike ready to be
deeply impressed by the news. With brief, sharp
sentences they broke across one another’s speech,
turning pale faces and glittering eyes from one
to another.</p>

<p>“Brooks’s companions held back those who
tried to go to Sumner’s help!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a brutal and cowardly—”</p>

<p>“If the North is not utterly craven—”</p>

<p>“It’s the most atrocious thing they’ve dared
yet!”</p>

<p>“Beecher’s bibles are the thing to answer it
with!”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better!”</p>

<p>“If there’s any manhood at all in the North!”</p>

<p>After a little they grew calmer and went into
the office, where Hardaker related the details of
the event which was about to set both sections
of the country in an uproar. Presently Rhoda
asked what news he had had from his sister Julia,
lately married—Rhoda had been her bridesmaid—and
gone with her husband to Kansas. North
and South were in the midst of their bitter struggle
for the embryonic state, and from each settlers
were pouring into it, there to translate their convictions
into guerrilla warfare, while their friends
at home waited fearfully each day as news came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of battle, murder, the burning of houses, the
sacking of towns.</p>

<p>“We’ve heard nothing worse, so far, than
you’ve seen in the papers already. But it won’t
be long. They’re cooking up some dastardly outrage
and any day we may hear that Lawrence has
been burned and all the people killed. Mother
never opens the ‘Tribune’ herself now. She waits
for me to look in it first and then tell her what the
Kansas letters say.”</p>

<p>Hardaker was asked to stay to dinner, and
Rhoda went to tell her mother of the guest. Then
the two men drew their chairs close together and
spoke in low tones.</p>

<p>“I saw Conners this morning,” said Horace,
“and he told me that they’re watching his place so
close now that it isn’t safe to have them come
there any more. And he’s made up his mind to
go out to Kansas anyway, and expects to leave in
a month or two. So we’ve got to have a new station.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” mused Dr. Ware, “there must be some
place not too far from the river where they can
hide as soon as possible after they cross. I wonder
if I could manage it here. If I could, this would
be just the place. The house sets up so high that
they could steer their course for it from the other
side, and, once across, they could easily make their
way up here after dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“But could you take care of them safely?” the
other asked with evident surprise.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t heretofore, but it may be different
now!” and he leaned forward with a smile of
satisfaction. “You saw how moved Rhoda was
just now. She’s been reading ‘Uncle Tom’s
Cabin’ and it’s had a profound effect upon her,
just as I hoped it would. She went down to
Cincinnati with me last week and I took her to
Levi Coffin’s. She was very much interested in
the talk there—you know about what it was.
After she’s had time to think about it—Rhoda
doesn’t do things on impulse, you know—I believe,
Horace, my girl will be ready to help me
out!”</p>

<p>“But what about—” Hardaker began, then
stopped, embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I know what you mean. I wouldn’t, of course,
ask Mrs. Ware to concern herself actively in the
matter, or to know any more about it than she
wanted to. But we could depend on her to keep
her own counsel. Charlotte need not know anything
about it—although she’d be pretty sure to
find out all about it before long. Then she’d tell
me frequently and forcibly, just what kind of a
pickpocket she considers me—” He stopped a
moment, smiling indulgently, but went on, conviction
in his tone: “But she wouldn’t tell. She’d
be loyal to me. And as for my colored man Jim
and his wife Lizzie, in the kitchen, they’ll do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
under the sun to help the thing along. They
bought their freedom, only a few years ago. I
think, Horace, it will be all right!”</p>

<p>Rhoda found her mother and sister in the big,
cool sitting-room, Mrs. Ware darning stockings
and Charlotte at the piano, playing “The Battle
of Prague.” She wheeled round at Rhoda’s announcement
of the guest for dinner.</p>

<p>“That Black Abolitionist!” she exclaimed
scornfully, her eyes flashing. “I shall not sit at
the table with him!”</p>

<p>“Charlotte!” her mother chided. “Your
father’s guest! Be ashamed!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you decline to sit at the table with
father?” Rhoda asked quietly, but with an unaccustomed
tone in her voice that made the other
look at her sharply. Her face and manner still
betrayed signs of her recent agitation. Charlotte
saw them and wondered if anything had been
happening between her and Horace Hardaker.
She did not know that he had more than once
plead his suit with Rhoda and had been denied.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“In the office, with father.”</p>

<p>Had he then been making love to Rhoda and
was he now getting the matter settled with their
father? Then it would be impossible not to be
present at the dinner table. But for the present
she would stick to her guns. She rose and moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
toward the door, giving her hoopskirts an angry
swish.</p>

<p>“No!” she paused to say, with emphasis, “you
cannot expect me, thinking as I do about Horace
Hardaker, to sit at the same table with him. I
shall ask Lizzie to save my dinner for me and eat
it after he goes away.”</p>

<p>But when they met in the dining-room Charlotte
was already there, arranging flowers on the table,
a rose in her hair and another at her throat and
Hardaker’s place set beside her own. At first his
manner toward her was courteous, though formal,
but as the meal progressed and she smiled upon
him, rallied him, and talked to him and at him
with audacious little speeches, his reserve melted
and his attention was gradually centered upon her.
Every now and then she stole a glance at Rhoda,
secretly wondering and discomfited that her sister
did not seem more disturbed or make some effort
to prevent her from monopolizing Hardaker’s
attention. She reassured herself with thinking,
“But she never does show things out much.”</p>

<p>After dinner Dr. and Mrs. Ware left the three
young people together upon the veranda. Horace
asked Rhoda about her visit to Levi Coffin’s in
Cincinnati, but Charlotte cut in with some saucy
remarks that set them to laughing and when presently
she strolled off across the lawn to a grape
arbor at the other side of the yard, he was in close
attendance. Rhoda brought her sewing from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
house and began hemming the flounces for Charlotte’s
gown.</p>

<p>There was a suggestion of triumph in Charlotte’s
expression and manner when they came
back and all three stood under the butternut tree
beside the east gate, where Dr. Ware’s carriage
was waiting for him to dismiss a patient. Had
she not taken young Hardaker away from her
sister at once and herself appropriated all his attention?
But when she could not help seeing that
the ordinary friendliness between the two was
neither disturbed nor accentuated, she began to
think that perhaps her previous surmise had been
mistaken. And when Horace bade them a casual
good-by, in which her keen eyes could discover no
trace of any unusual sentiment, and drove away
with their father, she decided that after all it had
not been worth while. “But anyway it was more
fun than eating dinner alone,” she thought. “And
when Mr. Jefferson Delavan comes—”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>We blundering humans are much given to looking
back over our lives and saying, “There we
made a mistake. If it were to do over again we
would do thus and so, and then things would turn
out much better and happier.”</p>

<p>But if we could go back and live our lives over
again, at how many of the turning points would
we have the courage, or the desire, to take the
other direction? How often would we care to
risk any different combination of events than that
which we had formerly dared? For experience
has taught us, at least, how endless and how
momentous is the line of events, not only for ourselves
but also for a growing multitude of others,
that we set in motion with each choice of the forking
road. Moved by our own desires and the
compelling force of outward circumstances we
travel over the course the first time, choosing our
route with little thought for the intricate coils of
consequence that hang upon our steps. But if
we were to journey over it again would not our
feet drag at the turnings and waver back to the
path we already knew, rather than venture blindly
upon some new chain of events, leading none could
tell whither and ending only with the end of time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Thus did it happen that Dr. Amos M. Ware
in after years sometimes debated with himself as
to whether he made a mistake in not speaking
sooner to his daughter Rhoda about the work, of
deep concern to him, in which he hoped to enlist
her sympathy and help. Often did he ask himself
if perhaps it would not have been better for her
had he laid his plan before her at once, on the
very day of Hardaker’s visit, when her mind and
heart were so deeply impressed that there would
have been little doubt of her acquiescence. But
he wanted to talk with her more, to give her more
things to read, and so to lead her deeper into the
heart of the fires with which North and South
were burning. And in the meantime came
Jefferson Delavan.</p>

<p>Afterwards he was wont to say to himself that
if he had spoken, and everything had been arranged
and the work started before that event
happened, the young man’s coming would have
made little difference to Rhoda, that then he would
simply have gone away again and that would have
been the end of it. But he was wont also to
reassure himself with the thought that perhaps
Delavan would have come again anyway, and that,
even if he had not returned, perhaps it would have
been no better for Rhoda. But the “ifs” and
“perhapses” so tangled up his reflections that he
always ended by thinking he would not quite like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
to risk acting differently if it were to do over
again.</p>

<p>Of course, there would have been a story anyway,
no matter what Dr. Ware might have done
at that particular juncture, nor what the consequences
of his action might have been. It would
not have been the story I am about to relate, and
perhaps Jefferson Delavan would not have been
in it. But given Rhoda Ware and given her
environment, it would have been bound to be a
story somewhat out of the ordinary. As to that,
however, in every human life there is a story that
needs only adequate telling to make it seem more
interesting than life does to the most of us.</p>

<p>Rhoda Ware’s father did not know what she
thought, nor, indeed, whether or not she had any
conviction, upon the right or wrong of the system
of helping and hasting fugitive slaves through the
northern states to Canada and freedom which in
that day was known, and has passed into history,
as the Underground Railroad. He did feel sure,
and his pride in her increased with the thought,
that if she were not convinced of its righteousness,
although it was in defiance of the law, she would
not engage in it. But he also felt sure that if she
saw the matter as did he and his co-workers, as
a question of the right of the individual conscience
above the general law, she would come to his
assistance with courage and enthusiasm. And
therefore before broaching the subject he wished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to make sure of her convictions upon all the points
that led up to this practical climax.</p>

<p>Like thousands upon thousands of others, her
first keen feeling upon the subject of slavery was
aroused by the reading of Mrs. Stowe’s fateful
book. She was only one of the unnumbered host
for whom its emotional appeal was the first incentive
to active opposition. The influence of
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin” upon the course of events
preceding the Civil War is proof of how much
more ready we Americans are to be moved by our
emotions than by argument, of how much more
willing we are to think with our hearts than with
our heads.</p>

<p>Dr. Ware put into her hands Senator Sumner’s
speech on “The Crime against Kansas,” the cause
of the assault upon him, which was being read all
through the north by the hundred thousand copies,
and he brought her reports of the huge meetings
of indignation held in Boston, New York, and
other cities, and presided over and addressed by
men of national fame. From Kansas the news
of the sacking of Lawrence added fuel to the flame
of anger that was sweeping over the North, and
to the feeling of horror and reprobation in which
Rhoda joined there was added in her mind the note
of personal resentment. For a letter from her
friend Julia Hammerton, Horace Hardaker’s sister,
gave an intimate account of the attack and
told of the indignities and loss herself and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
husband had suffered at the hands of the border
ruffians.</p>

<p>Rhoda was deeply moved by these events and
day by day became more keenly interested, while
her father, watching her closely, decided that soon
he would speak to her upon the project he had so
much at heart. He purposed to lay before her
the whole question, tell her of the part which it
was his desire to take in the work of the Underground
Railroad, and ask for her coöperation.</p>

<p>Underneath the apparent peace in which the
Ohio river town of Hillside basked in the sweet
May sunshine of that day when Rhoda and her
father drove up the hill on their return from Cincinnati,
feeling on the slavery question ran deep
and bitter. And the events which had happened
since that day had intensified the heat and the bitterness
until, just as all over the country, men felt
that they were dwelling over a volcano which
might break out at any moment, none could tell
with what violence and destruction. The pro-slavery
element of the town, quick to seize every
opportunity of expressing its friendliness for the
South, held a meeting at which resolutions were
passed lauding Representative Brooks for his
chivalry in coming to the defense of his kinsman
and his state, and declaring that he deserved the
admiration of all who believed in honor and manliness
for the justly deserved punishment he had
meted out to a notorious abolitionist. And then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
money was donated with enthusiasm for the purchase
of a cane to be presented to him which should
bear the inscription, “Use knock-down arguments”
and the device of a broken human head.</p>

<p>The anti-slavery element planned to hold a
meeting two nights later at which they proposed
to express their feelings in denunciation of Brooks
and in praise of Sumner and his speech, to voice
their indignation over the course of events in Kansas,
and to ask for money for the relief of the free-state
settlers and for the sending of more colonists
with whom to swell their numbers. It was Dr.
Ware’s intention to take Rhoda to this meeting,
at which he was to make the principal speech, and
immediately afterward to have with her the conversation
which he believed would secure her help.</p>

<p>But in the afternoon of that day Jefferson Delavan
appeared at the door of his office and hoped
he might present his respects to Mrs. Ware and
Miss Rhoda.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>“‘A felon’s blow,’ indeed! O, la, you horrid
thing!”</p>

<p>Charlotte Ware, alone in the living-room,
rocked violently back and forth a few times,
apparently as an outlet for her indignation, then
turned her flushed cheeks and snapping eyes again
upon the New York “Tribune” in her hands. She
stayed her rocking for a moment, absorbed in the
article which had aroused her anger, but presently
broke out again:</p>

<p>“‘The symbol of the South is the bludgeon!’
Oh, you wretch!”</p>

<p>She struck the page with her fist, but went on
reading again until she came to some sentiment
which gave a still deeper prod to her anger. Then
springing to her feet, she crushed the journal into
a ball, whipped off her slipper and began to spank
vigorously the offending news. The paper flew
from her hands and the kitten, which had tumbled
from her lap, whisked after it. She pursued and
sent it across the room with another blow, ran
after it and beat it again, exclaiming, “There!
That’s what you deserve!”</p>

<p>“Charlotte, what are you doing?” It was her
father’s voice at the door, and without looking up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
she answered, between her whacks at the tattered
paper:</p>

<p>“It’s that old meeting in New York about
Sumner and I’m giving that horrid Beecher person’s
speech what it deserves, and I wish it was
him!”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Miss Charlotte!” came quick response
in a strange masculine voice, followed by a hearty
laugh and two or three little handclaps.</p>

<p>She wheeled, her slipper in her hand, and saw
a young man beside her father in the doorway, a
good-looking young man, broad-shouldered and
erect of stature. It flashed upon her that this
must be Mr. Jefferson Delavan. Under cover
of picking up the kitten she adroitly slipped on
her shoe. As she came forward, blushing and
confused, trying to cover her embarrassment with
an extra tilting of her hoopskirt and a pouting,
defiant little smile, she seemed to Delavan to be
little more than a spoiled, amusing child, so sweet
and dainty to look at that to indulge her would be
a pleasure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware was delighted by Delavan’s coming,
and would listen to no other arrangement than
that he should stay with them, at least over night.
When she heard this Charlotte considered whether
or not she should deny herself the excitement of
attending the meeting that night. She had already
accepted the escort of a young admirer
whose sentiments were as vehemently pro-slavery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
as her own, and he had confided to her that something
interesting was likely to happen. Perhaps
it would be just as interesting to stay at home and
prevent Mr. Delavan from showing Rhoda too
much attention. But there would be opportunity
for that afterward, and the meeting would be only
that evening. So she decided not to send word
to her escort that she had changed her mind.
When she came downstairs ready to go, her
father, meeting her in the hall, said, with more
gravity than he was accustomed to use toward her:</p>

<p>“I hope, Charlotte, you won’t let that young
Saunders forget who you are.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, father,” she responded assuringly.
“I won’t let him hiss you, anyway.”</p>

<p>With much inward regret Dr. Ware gave up
his plan of taking Rhoda to the meeting with him.
She and her mother sat on the veranda with their
guest and Mrs. Ware told them anecdotes about
her own and his mother’s girlhood and of the intimacy
which had caused the young women to be
known among all their acquaintance as “the two
alter egos.” “And after awhile,” said Mrs.
Ware, in happy reminiscence, “they always called
one of us ‘alter’ and the other ‘ego,’ without making
any distinction as to which was which.”</p>

<p>In the days of that friendship they had had
their miniatures painted, each for the other, and
Delavan had brought, from his dead mother’s
possessions, that of Mrs. Ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“I thought you might like to have it again, Mrs.
Ware, madam,” he said, in his slightly ceremonious
manner, “either for yourself, as a memento
of your girlhood, or to give to Miss Rhoda.”</p>

<p>Rhoda bent over it with eager, tender interest.
“Oh, mother!” she exclaimed, “does this really
look as you did then? How you have changed!”
And, indeed, in her matronly figure, short and
plump, there was little suggestion of the trim and
graceful outlines of the young girl in the picture.
The brown hair had grown quite gray, the bright
color had faded from the face, and the dainty contour
of cheek, chin and throat had been despoiled
by the quarter-century which had since passed over
her head. But although the years had stolen her
beauty they had left in its place a worthy gift.
For motherliness informed her features, her look
was tender, and the grace of gentleness controlled
her manner.</p>

<p>Delavan was at Rhoda’s elbow, looking at the
miniature with her, and now and then stealing a
glance from the portrait to the girl’s face. “You
needn’t do that, Jeff,” Mrs. Ware smiled at him,
“for you can’t find the least resemblance to me in
Rhoda’s features. She’s like her father in looks
and disposition and everything,” and her eyes
rested fondly upon her first-born.</p>

<p>“But how much it is like Charlotte!” Rhoda
insisted, and pointed out the likeness in mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and chin, nose and brow, in expression and in
coloring.</p>

<p>Moved to tender retrospection by the memories
that came crowding upon her, she told them about
her courtship and marriage. “It was at White
Sulphur Springs that I first met your father,
Rhoda,” she said, “and from the very start he
never seemed to have eyes for anybody but me.
He was from the North, you know, from Providence,
and he was taking a horseback trip through
the South for his health. He had letters to the
Colbys, good friends of ours who were there too,
and so I soon met him. Ah, what happy times
we used to have at White Sulphur!” and she went
on to tell of rides and dances and flirtations in
which they heard the names of gay young gallants,
known to them now as men of prominence
in Washington or capital cities in the South.</p>

<p>“But father—what became of him?” reminded
Rhoda.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was always wherever I was, as long as
he stayed at the Springs, that summer. Afterwards
he was with the Colbys, who owned the
next plantation to ours, tutoring their boys. That
was such a gay winter—something going on all
the time—dear me!” She broke off into a happy
little laugh and the spirit of that long dead time
flared up again in the instinctive coquetry with
which she tossed her head, moved in her chair and
flourished her fan. Delavan looked at her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
smiled, thinking of the Amos M. Ware of those
days and wondering what would be his account of
that winter. Rhoda’s eyes noted the movement
and the expression and she thought, “That’s just
like Charlotte!”</p>

<p>“My people did not want me to marry him,”
Mrs. Ware went on, “because he was a northerner.
But one day he came to take me to ride—two such
splendid black horses they were, and how they
could travel! Well, we went, for I always had
my own way, and such a wild ride we had! We
galloped and galloped, and I was very gay, as I
always was, but your father, Rhoda, looked so
serious and strange that I was a little frightened
inside of me, though I wouldn’t have let him know
it for the world. I suppose that made me—a
little—worse than usual, and he didn’t say anything,
but just made the horses go faster and
faster, and after a while he rode close beside me
and seized my arm and said— O, never mind what
he said!”—her voice trembled and almost broke
and it was a moment before she went on. “Well,
the end of it was that we ran away and were married.
Of course my people were very angry about
it, but they forgave me, as I knew they would,
though they never did quite forgive him. He
took me away at once to New York, where he
wanted to study medicine, and I never lived in the
South again.”</p>

<p>Rhoda listened with a little tremor in her nerves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and her heart beating faster. Vividly the vision
came before her—the pretty, gay young woman
with her wilful coquetries and the masterful young
man urging their horses faster and faster—and
they were her father and mother! How strange
it seemed to think of them under the stress of such
a wild, compelling love. That, then, was what
love was like—for its sake her mother had dared
the anger of her people, and had given up them
and their love and her home and all her early
associations which had meant to her such great
happiness. The moon was swimming upward
through a sea-like expanse of dim blue sky and
casting its spell of beauty over the flower-decked
yard, the solemn tree shapes guarding the street
and the glimpses of river beyond. Fireflies were
weaving patterns of light down among the shrubbery
and behind it the white palings of the fence
gleamed, unreal as the walls of a dream palace.
Up from the rose-laden bushes, on the softly stirring
air, came waves of fragrance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware was going on with a story about
Delavan’s mother and herself and Rhoda heard
her mention her “old mammy”! Instantly the
girl’s thought flashed to what her father had told
her a little while before, and the tears came to her
eyes at the realizing sense of how his love had
shielded for his wife her memories and her pleasure
in them. This, then, was what love was like—but
suddenly imagination drove thought away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and again she saw the vision of those two young
lovers galloping faster and faster, while love plied
whip and spur. Then without warning her mind
played a trick upon her and there flashed across
it a memory of her own—of children playing
pirates, herself and the other girls princesses in
short dresses and pantalettes, and the man now
sitting beside her, a long-legged boy, bearing down
upon their palace, singling her out and bearing
her away to his treasure cave.</p>

<p>They strolled down into the yard, but Mrs.
Ware did not like the dew on the grass and went
back to the veranda. Rhoda and Delavan idled
on through the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I’ve just been thinking
of?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“No. How could I? But—” she plucked a
red rose and held it toward him, her upper lip
lifting in a smile that sent a brightness over her
face, “a flower for your thoughts!”</p>

<p>He took it, pressed it to his lips and fastened
it in his buttonhole. They were passing a great
bed of white petunias, gleaming like ghost flowers
in the moonlight and sending forth sweet odors
that filled the air all round about.</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” he began, and to Rhoda the
sweetness of their fragrance seemed suddenly to
be translated into his tones and to be coursing
through her own veins. Never again was she to
be able to sense the odor of petunias without darting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
memory of how he pressed her rose to his lips
and said, “I was thinking of that evening when
we played pirates. Do you remember?”</p>

<p>They had come to the entrance of the grape
arbor, at the western side of the yard. It was
dark with the heavy foliage of the vines, and
Rhoda hesitated an instant as she glanced at the
shadows within, checkered here and there with
gleams of light, and gave a faint exclamation at
his words. A dim prescience, barely realized,
crossed her consciousness, as of something, some
destiny, waiting for her within those shadows. A
broad band of moonlight, shining through the
entrance, lay across the seat.</p>

<p>“You startled me, a little,” she said, sitting
down in the white glow, “because—it’s very curious—I
thought of that evening myself, just now!”</p>

<p>“You did? What a coincidence! Then you
must remember how hard I had to work to beat
Lloyd Corey, the other pirate, to your palace, and
how I chose you out of all the princesses and carried
you off? Do you remember? Lloyd and
I had a duel about you, with cornstalks, that evening,
after you girls went in, and I won, and after
that he had to let me pick you out every time—do
you remember—Rhoda—that I did always choose
you? The very first day that you came, Harry
Morehead and Lloyd and I talked over you and
all the other girls that were there, comparing you
and saying which we thought we would like best,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and I told them that I liked Rhoda Ware the
best of them all and that I was going to marry her
some day. That was just boy’s talk, of course,
but—Rhoda—Rhoda Ware—we are man and
woman now, and I love you, and I—still mean to
marry you, if you will have me—will you?”</p>

<p>He had been standing before her, bending low,
speaking in quick, soft tones, in which she felt a
passionate masterfulness that set her own pulses
throbbing. Somewhere in the back of her mind
she had a dim memory of her father seizing her
mother by the arm and galloping—galloping— Unconsciously
she moved to one side and nervously
swept her wide skirts from the bench. He sat
down beside her, and as the moonlight fell full
upon her figure he saw that her bosom was heaving
and her hands trembling.</p>

<p>“Have you—not been—too hasty?” she asked,
in a troubled voice. “We know so little of each
other!”</p>

<p>“I know I love you and want you for my wife.
I knew that when we were together on the boat,
and in Cincinnati, and I know it now more surely
even than I did then. But if you are not so sure
of yourself, if you want to know more about me, I
will wait for your answer. But you won’t deny
me at once—you won’t send me away for good,
now, will you, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>He bent toward her, his masterfulness all gone,
face and voice full of pleading. She gave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
one swift, smiling glance, bright in the moonlight,
and whispered, “No, not now—let us wait a little.”</p>

<p>He seized her hand. It was cold and trembling.
She let him hold it for a moment in both
of his. “Rhoda, Rhoda, you love me a little!”
he exclaimed, as he felt it fluttering within his
palms.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, a little—I don’t know,” she hesitated.
From down the hill came the sound of voices.
“They are coming home,” she went on in steadier
tones. “Let us go back to the house.”</p>

<p>The fact had not yet presented itself to Rhoda
Ware’s remembrance that Jefferson Delavan was
a slaveholder. She knew that he owned a plantation
which he worked with slave labor, but her
thoughts had been filled by his personality alone,
without reference to his surroundings or conditions.
And during the evening his presence and
her mother’s reminiscences had swept all her
thoughts and emotions away from the immediate
present and the outer world. For the time being
it was quite outside her consciousness that he had
any connection with the institution of slavery.</p>

<p>As for Delavan, he did not know anything
about Dr. Ware’s sentiments on that burning
question. The subject had not been mentioned
during their conversations on the boat and since
his arrival in the afternoon he had seen but little
of his host. Mrs. Ware, with her delight at his
coming and her talk about his mother and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
girlhood days, and Rhoda’s presence, had engrossed
his attention. Moreover, Charlotte’s
performance, upon which he and Dr. Ware had
unexpectedly come, had been misleading to whatever
thought he had given to the matter. And
that young lady was about to make deeper the
impression.</p>

<p>Seated on the veranda steps she lamented her
mistake in going to the meeting. “There was no
fun at all,” she declared. “It was as orderly and
quiet as a funeral. I wish it had been old Sumner’s
funeral! And how they did talk about
‘Bully Brooks’!” She caught up the kitten,
which at the sound of her voice had come purring
against her skirts, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Prince of Walesy, you’ve got to have your
name changed! You’re going to be ‘Bully
Brooks’ after this! Because he’s the best man
out!”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Miss Charlotte! You’re a girl
after my own heart!” Delavan heartily approved.
They were alone on the veranda, Dr. Ware having
hurried to his office, where a patient was waiting.
At that moment Mrs. Ware and Rhoda
returned, with cool drinks, and the talk turned to
other subjects. But Delavan had gained a distinct
impression that Dr. Ware’s family was pro-slavery
in sentiment.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, when Rhoda went into her
sister’s bedroom to say good-night, she found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Charlotte sitting before a mirror with their mother’s
miniature, carefully comparing it with her
own reflection. “Come here, Rhoda,” she said,
“and see how much this looks like me!”</p>

<p>Rhoda bent over her shoulder. The girl had
arranged her hair like that in the picture, and the
resemblance was striking. “I know,” said Rhoda.
“I noticed it at once, but your hair this way makes
it plainer. You must look very much like mother
did when she was your age—when they were married.”</p>

<p>Charlotte cast a glance back into the other’s
face. “Yes,” she said, “I must be the image of
her. That’s why father loves me so much more
than he does you.”</p>

<p>Rhoda turned sharply away. “Sister! He
doesn’t! We are both his daughters, and he loves
us both.”</p>

<p>“Of course he does,” Charlotte replied calmly.
“But he loves me a great deal more than he does
you.”</p>

<p>And in her secret heart Rhoda knew that her
sister spoke the truth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>Never had Dr. Ware been more surprised than
he was when Jefferson Delavan came to him the
next morning and said, without preliminary:</p>

<p>“I wish to tell you, Dr. Ware, sir, that I love
your daughter, Miss Rhoda, and desire to make
her my wife.”</p>

<p>For a moment he gazed in speechless astonishment.
“It seems to me, Mr. Delavan,” he presently
found tongue to say, “that you are being
rather precipitate. Have you spoken to Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir. She asks for time to make sure
of herself. But she does not leave me without
hope. You must remember, sir, that we knew
each other when we were children.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, for a few weeks, I believe! And
you’ve been in each other’s company a few hours
since! Do you think that is long enough for you
to acquire such knowledge of each other as you
ought to have before venturing upon this important
step?”</p>

<p>“It has been long enough, sir, for me to discover
that she has a sweet and noble nature and to
know that I love her. And I do not ask from her
at present any definite promise. I ask only for
your permission to endeavor to win her love and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
her promise as soon as possible. You know who
I am and I am sure you will acquit me of presumption,
sir, if I remind you that my name is
an honored one in my state and neighborhood. I
trust you will have any inquiries made that you
like concerning my personal character, and I shall
be happy to give you at any time an account of my
financial affairs, in order that you may satisfy
yourself I can give your daughter a home and
a position such as she deserves.”</p>

<p>“Your attitude is that of an honorable man,
Mr. Delavan, and if the matter goes on I shall
take advantage of your offer.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware arose and began moving back and
forth across the room. “But you are a slaveholder,
I believe. Do you think it wise for two
people to marry who hold such opposing opinions
about a question that both think of importance?”</p>

<p>It was the young man’s turn to be surprised.
He rose and looked at the other in astonishment.
“What do you mean, Dr. Ware? I thought—Miss
Charlotte—?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand. Charlotte likes to talk and
she says a great deal more than she means. But
Rhoda and I are in sympathy on the question of
slavery, and I am what you southern people call
a fanatic and a black abolitionist. If I had supposed
that our meeting on the boat would lead to
anything more than mere passing acquaintance I
would have spoken of my sentiments then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“It seems to me, sir, that if husband and wife
love each other truly, matters of opinion are of
little consequence between them.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware shook his head gravely. “A matter
of opinion? My young friend, it is much more
than that, for both of you. But this is something
for you and Rhoda to settle between yourselves.
As for me, it would grieve me deeply to see Rhoda
marry you, just because you are a slaveholder,
and I must tell you right now that whatever influence
I have with my daughter shall be used
against your suit. Nevertheless,”—he held out
his hand, the young man gripped it, and they
shook hands warmly, although each saw kindling
in the other’s eyes the fires of opposition.
“Nevertheless,” Dr. Ware went on, “you have
my consent to win her if you can. Frankly,
though, I don’t believe you can do it after she
realizes that to be your wife she must be the
mistress of slaves.”</p>

<p>While Delavan was having his interview with
her father, Rhoda, clasped in her mother’s arms,
was hearing exclamations of delight and forecasts
of happiness: “Rhoda, dear! how happy
this makes me! Yes, I know, you haven’t given
him a final answer—and that’s quite right—keep
him off for a while—don’t let him think you’re
easily won—but of course you’ll have him finally!
Oh, Rhoda, my little girl—to think that you’re
going to marry Adeline’s boy! If she knows—up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
in heaven—she’s just as pleased over it as I
am! If she could only have lived to see it! And
he’s such a dear fellow! Rhoda, dear, you’ll be
so happy, I know you will—and it is such a beautiful
life down there!”</p>

<p>She heard her younger daughter whistling in
the hall. “There’s Charlotte,” she exclaimed.
“I think I’d better send her downtown on some
errand.” And wiping tears of joy from her eyes
she hurried out to complete her plan of eliminating
Charlotte from the life of the household for the
rest of the morning.</p>

<p>Rhoda went down to the veranda, taking with
her the white silk out of which she was making a
bonnet for her mother, with her heart full of
tenderest emotion. Mrs. Ware’s delight and
enthusiasm had made still warmer and deeper her
own thrilling happiness. As her fingers flew over
her work she listened to the faint tones of her
lover’s voice, and a soft glow stole into her eyes.
Delavan surprised it there when presently he came
from her father’s office.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” he exclaimed. She saw the love-light
flame across his face and the color mounted
to her brow. He sought to take her hand, but
she drew it away, saying shyly, “Not yet.”</p>

<p>He went into the house to bid Mrs. Ware good-by,
for he was going at once, in order to catch
the forenoon trip of the ferry boat across the
river. When he came out Rhoda put down her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
work and walked with him down the broad path
between the hedges of lilac to the front gate.</p>

<p>“When can I have my answer?” he pleaded.
“The next time I come?”</p>

<p>On the instant there sprang up in her heart a
something she had never felt before. It was not
the first time she had listened to the pleadings
of a would-be lover, but never before had there
been one who had not got his answer, frank and
straightforward, at once; never one toward whom
she had felt this instinctive impulse to enjoy his
suspense. Serious-minded offspring of her father
though she was, yet it was not for nothing that
she was her mother’s daughter. Already she
knew what her answer was to be and knew that she
could give it to him at any moment. Her short
upper lip lifted in a flashing little smile that illumined
her whole face. Delavan drew toward
her, his eyes upon the soft curves of her mouth.</p>

<p>“How can I tell?” she said. “There is so
much to think over—I must have time.”</p>

<p>“Your mother would be very pleased!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear mother, I know,” she murmured
fondly. “She loved your mother so dearly. And
father? You talked with him, just now?”</p>

<p>“He says that I may win you if I can.” It did
not occur to him to say anything about the doubt
Dr. Ware had expressed of his success, or the
attitude her father had warningly declared he
would take. All that had been swept out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
mind—he had not even thought it of much consequence
at the time. And now, looking down
upon Rhoda’s blushing face, he forgot everything
but the hope that if he could induce her to lift her
downcast eyes he might surprise surrender therein.
But he was to be disappointed in that, for when
presently he did look into their gray depths they
were merely gentle and serious.</p>

<p>“When may I come again?”</p>

<p>“We shall all be glad to see you whenever you
come—Mr. Delavan—”</p>

<p>“At least you might call me Jeff,” he interrupted,
“as you did when we were children!”</p>

<p>“Well then, Jeff,” and her manner took on with
the word a shade more of intimacy, which sent his
eyes flying once more to hers. “I’m sure—Jeff—”
this time she said it mockingly—“mother
will be pleased if you come again soon. And
we’ll all be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! There’s so much we haven’t talked
over yet about those happy days we had so long
ago— And we might play pirates again—if
you’ll bring Lloyd Corey with you! He was such
a nice boy! I’d really like to see him again.”</p>

<p>“Confound Lloyd Corey! Shall I have to
carry you off, as I did that time, or shall you have
something to tell me then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t promise—” she hesitated and her
voice took on an intonation as she spoke his name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
that sent a thrill to his heart,—“Jeff—anything
about it—what I shall say, or whether I can have
anything to say then, more than now. But I
would like to see Lloyd Corey again!”</p>

<p>Leaning upon the gate, Rhoda watched her
lover’s figure as he swung down the long, tree-bowered
street. When she turned she saw her
father coming down the path and waited there,
blushing and casting up at him now and again a
shy glance.</p>

<p>“Young Delavan surprised me very much just
now,” he began. “I told him, as I suppose he
reported to you, that he had my consent to win you
if he could. I don’t suppose, though, that he
also told you I didn’t believe he could and that it
would grieve me deeply to see you marry him.”</p>

<p>Rhoda bent upon him surprised eyes. “Why,
father, what do you mean? Don’t you like him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rhoda, I like him well enough, personally,
but you know how I feel about slavery and
all who are responsible for it. Have you forgotten
that Jefferson Delavan is a slaveholder?”</p>

<p>The color faded from her face, and into her
wide, gray eyes, fastened upon his, there came a
look, as of some wild thing suddenly stricken, that
smote his heart. She flinched a little and he turned
away, that he might not see her pain.</p>

<p>“I guess, daughter, you hadn’t thought about
that,” he went on, kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“No,” she repeated after him, “I—I hadn’t
thought about that.”</p>

<p>“But you knew that he has slaves, that he works
his plantation with slave labor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, I knew it, somewhere back in my
mind, but I didn’t think anything about it. I
didn’t think of anything but—just him!”</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to think about it now,” he said
in a gently suggestive tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she assented dully, “I’ll have to think
about it now”—she stopped, then went on with a
flash of pain in her tone, “when I can think!”</p>

<p>“You must try to realize,” her father went on,
“before it is too late, how you would like to be
the mistress of slaves, supported by slave labor,
your welfare and all your interests so bound up
with the system of slavery that you will be forced
to become one of its defenders.”</p>

<p>Her head drooped and she turned away with
a little gesture of one hand as though begging him
to stop. He waited a moment and she faced him
again and said slowly, with little breaks and catchings
of her breath: “Father! I don’t believe I
could do it! I—love him—I want to be his wife—but—slaves!
I couldn’t! I know I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>She broke down then and began to sob softly
under her breath. He put his hand through her
arm and led her up the path to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware came out to meet them, anxiety in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
her face. “What is it? What’s the matter?”
she questioned.</p>

<p>Rhoda straightened up and rested one hand
upon her mother’s shoulder. Mrs. Ware was
short and plump of stature and Rhoda, tall and
of slender build like her father, looked down into
her face with tear-filled eyes.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she began, her tone already self-controlled,
“I’m afraid you’ll feel badly about it, but—I
don’t think I can marry Jeff Delavan, after
all.”</p>

<p>“Rhoda! Child! What is the trouble? What
have you been saying to her, Amos?”</p>

<p>“There, mother! You mustn’t blame father.
He only reminded me that Jeff is a slaveholder.
Of course, I knew it before, but I—just hadn’t
thought about it. Mother, you’ll think me foolish,
I know, but I don’t—I don’t think I can
marry him.”</p>

<p>“Is that all? Dear child, you’re making a
mountain out of nothing at all! Come with me,
dear. Your father has been putting foolish
notions into your head. Come, we’ll talk it over,
and you’ll soon see there’s nothing in that to keep
you apart!”</p>

<p>Rhoda bent her head for a moment upon her
mother’s shoulder and, half reluctantly drawing
herself from her father’s arm, which seemed even
more unwilling to let her go, started into the
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>In their absorption they had not heard Charlotte
coming up the walk. “What’s the matter?” she
exclaimed, seizing her father’s hand. “Is Rhoda
sick?”</p>

<p>“You may tell her, father,” Rhoda turned to
say, as she and Mrs. Ware disappeared through
the door.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” Charlotte demanded briskly,
as her father hesitated.</p>

<p>“Jeff Delavan wants to marry her.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Is that anything to cry about?” she
commented, sitting down on the veranda step.
“Where is he? Is he crying too?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone home—he went a little while ago.”</p>

<p>She looked up surprised. “Oh, has he? I
thought he’d still be here. But what’s Rhoda
crying about? Because he’s gone away so soon?
Then why didn’t she keep him? She didn’t refuse
him, did she?”</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t give him a definite answer.
And since he went away she has remembered that
he is a slaveholder. You know how she and I
feel about slavery.”</p>

<p>Charlotte sprang to her feet excitedly. “You
don’t mean to say she’s going to take that into
account! I didn’t think she could be such a
goose!” She looked up at him with twinkling
eyes. “Father, why didn’t you take me down to
Cincinnati with you, so he could have seen me
first? Oh, well, I suppose he’ll come back again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
won’t he?” And with a toss of her head she ran
into the house, stopping at the door to throw back
at him an audacious laugh.</p>

<p>He gazed after her, an indulgent smile on his
face. Did the look of her and the ring of her
saucy laugh awaken some memory of the long ago
wherein flitted another dainty, girlish figure so
much like her that she sometimes startled him?
At any rate, a still warmth took possession of his
heart and drove out the slight resentment that
just now crept in when his wife took Rhoda away
to try to induce her to a course of action so directly
opposed to his own convictions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>“That’s just right, Rhoda.” Charlotte nodded
at herself in the mirror and smiled with satisfaction
as she turned this way and that, surveying
her reflection at different angles. “I hope you
won’t marry Jeff Delavan, for then I’d have to
learn how to do this myself.”</p>

<p>“You ought to learn how to make your own
clothes, anyway,” her mother commented reprovingly.
The three of them were in an upstairs
chamber used as a sewing-room, Rhoda fitting
upon her sister the bodice of a white gown and
Mrs. Ware, between stitches as she darned a
three-cornered tear in the muslin window curtain
which the kitten had just made, looking on and
making suggestions.</p>

<p>Charlotte tossed her head and tilted her hoopskirts
as she did some dancing steps in front of
the mirror. “Oh, what’s the use, as long as
Rhoda likes to sew and I don’t! You couldn’t,
mother, when you were my age. I hope she won’t
marry anybody as long as I’m at home. You’re
an awful goose, Rhoda. Suppose Jeff Delavan
is a slaveholder—what do you care about a pack
of dirty niggers? They’re better off as slaves,
anyway. Billy Saunders has lived in South Carolina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and he says you couldn’t find anybody anywhere
more contented and happy than the nigger
slaves down South and that they’re no more fit to
be free and take care of themselves than so many
babies.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Mrs. Ware, “it has always
seemed to me that they need white masters to
provide for their welfare. They really are not
competent to take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>Rhoda listened to their talk as she adjusted a
ruffled fichu about her sister’s shoulders, but made
no comment. Nobody but she knew how wistfully,
during these days, she was hearkening to arguments
in favor of slavery.</p>

<p>Charlotte surveyed herself critically in the glass
once more and patted the fichu with approval.
“It’s lovely, Rhoda, and I’m so glad you’re a
Black Abolitionist! No good-looking young slaveholder
would need to ask me more than once—that
is, he wouldn’t need to if he knew it, but it’s more
interesting to make them ask several times—didn’t
you use to think so, mother? The more slaves
he had the better I’d like him—and the more
times I’d let him propose. Oh, la! How lovely it
would be to have a dozen or so slaves ready to
come the minute you call, and every time you look
out of a window to see droves of them, all working
for you! That would just suit us, wouldn’t it,
Bully Brooks?” And she caught up the kitten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
from the floor in time to save the curtain, swaying
in the breeze, from another attack.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly silly of you, Rhoda,” she went on,
as she tilted out of the room, the kitten on her
shoulder, “to care any more about Jeff Delavan’s
having a lot of slaves than you would if they
were so many horses. Isn’t it, Bully Brooks?”</p>

<p>The kitten gave quick and loud response and
Mrs. Ware, with a frown in her voice, called after
her, “Charlotte!” But she heard in reply from
down the hall only a merry laugh and the whistled
strains of “Comin’ through the Rye.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte is not sympathetic,” said her mother
fondly, putting an arm around Rhoda and pressing
her cheek to her daughter’s, “but her ideas are
certainly correct. And any one will tell you so,
dear, who has lived in the South and knows what
slavery really is. You’ve no right, Rhoda, as I’ve
already told you, to set yourself up in judgment
on a subject you know nothing about, and against
those who know all about it. Why can’t you trust
your mother, honey?”</p>

<p>She put her hands upon her daughter’s shoulders
and looked up beseechingly into Rhoda’s
troubled face. “I know all about slavery, dearie,”
she went on, “for I lived in the heart of it until I
was married, and I give you my word the niggers
are far happier and better off under it than they
would be if they were free. They don’t want
freedom. And they are so grateful to their masters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and mistresses and so fond of them! Why,
dear, my old mammy loved me almost as much, I
do believe, as my mother did!”</p>

<p>Rhoda recalled what her father had told her
of that “old mammy’s” fate and pressed her lips
together in sudden fear lest, in spite of his injunction,
she might tell what she knew.</p>

<p>“I know, mother,” she said falteringly, “at
your home it seems to have been as near right as
it could be; but, mother, dear, they’re human
beings, and I can’t make it seem right, no matter
how much I think about it and try to see it as you
do, that they should be bought and sold!”</p>

<p>“That’s only because you don’t know much
about niggers, dear child! They’re not really
human beings, in the sense that we are. If you
had grown up among them as I did you would
understand that. Charlotte is quite right in saying
they are no more to be considered than horses.”</p>

<p>They sat down on the black horsehair sofa and
Mrs. Ware went on, her soft, southern tones full
of pleading, one hand fluttering over the girl in
little caressing touches: “If you knew them as I
do, Rhoda, and knew how contented they are, you
wouldn’t feel a moment’s hesitation. And everybody
lives so happily down there! Such hospitality,
such friendships, such enjoyment of life—everything
so gracious and charming! There’s
nothing like it in the North! How homesick it
makes me, even yet, to think of it! Oh, honey!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
If I could only see you settled in the midst of it,
you don’t know how happy it would make me!
And Jeff—I don’t believe you realize, Rhoda, how
much he loves you! You ought to have heard him
talk to me about you! Jeff would do anything to
make you happy!”</p>

<p>Rhoda’s head dropped to her mother’s shoulder.
“Oh, mother!” she cried, “I wish—I wish you
could convince me!”</p>

<p>When she carried her sewing down to the
veranda a little later Mrs. Ware’s eyes followed
her with a gaze of mingled longing and misgiving.
“Now she will go and talk with her father,” was
the mother’s thought, “and he will undo all that
I’ve gained.”</p>

<p>Rhoda saw that her father’s carriage was at the
east gate, waiting for him, and she had scarcely
seated herself with her sewing when he came out
from his door. “Oh, Rhoda,” he called, “will you
come here a minute, please?</p>

<p>“I’d like you to do something for me this
morning,” he went on as they stepped back into
the office. “You know where the Mallard place
is? The first one beyond Gilbertson’s. They
have sent in for some more medicine for their sick
child, but if there have been certain results I want
to make a change in the treatment. The man who
brought me the message didn’t know anything
about it and I’ve got a hurry call that’s likely to
keep me all day. I’ll give you two kinds of medicine,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and he began putting them up as he continued
talking, “and if the child is sleeping well
and has no fever you can leave this package—the
directions are written here. But if not I want it
to have this, until I go out there to-morrow.
Don’t say anything about having the two kinds,
but make your inquiries, and leave the package that
the symptoms call for, and tell them I’ll call
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“All right, father. I can ride Dolly, I suppose?
I’ll enjoy having a gallop this morning.”</p>

<p>“If she’d only been a boy,” he thought, as he
hurried into the carriage and drove away, “I’d
have made a doctor of her. It’s a pity she wasn’t—she’d
make a first-class one, if she wasn’t a
woman.” He held the thought regretfully for a
moment. But, radical though he was upon many
subjects, it did not occur to him that Rhoda could
be a woman and a physician at the same time.</p>

<p>As he drove down the main street, past the law
office of Horace Hardaker, that young man
rushed out and signaled him to stop. “If you’ve
got anything to tell me, Horace,” he said, reining
up at the sidewalk, “jump in and come along for a
few blocks. I’m in a hurry and can’t stop.”</p>

<p>“A piece of U. G. baggage came over the river
last night,” Hardaker began as they drove on, his
voice just above a whisper, “and went to Conners’
house, as he had been directed. You know they’ve
been keeping a close watch on Conners lately, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
this morning Marshal Hanscomb swooped down
while the baggage was still there. But Mrs. Conners
got him into a bonnet and veil and dress of
hers, while Conners kept the slave catchers at the
front door a few minutes. She did a lot of talking
and laughing in the kitchen, as if she was saying
good-by to some neighbor woman, and hustled him
out of the back door, just as Conners had to let
them in at the front. He got away all right, with
directions for going on to Gilbertson’s. If he gets
there they’ll hide him in their hollow haystack until
the immediate danger blows over. But the marshal
and his catchers are after him to-day, and it’s a
chance if he makes it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware’s face was serious. “No, Conners’
house won’t do any longer—it isn’t safe,” he commented,
in low tones. “We’ve got to find some
other place. My house is the best, if things turn
out all right. But I don’t know yet how it’s going
to be. You met that young man from Kentucky
there last week, the evening of the meeting. He’s
a slaveholder, but he wants to marry Rhoda.”</p>

<p>Hardaker made a sudden, nervous movement
and the doctor, casting a sidewise glance, saw a
flush overspread his face. “I know, Horace—that
is, I guessed,” he said kindly, “and I wish, from
the bottom of my heart, that she might have felt
differently about it.”</p>

<p>“So do I, doctor,” the other answered grimly,
“but—she didn’t. Is she—does she—” he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
on awkwardly and Dr. Ware took the burden of
the question from him.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t know yet what she’ll do. If she
decides to marry him that will put an end to my
scheme. I’d have to have somebody in the house
in sympathy with the work. Rhoda is so capable,
she could take the thing right into her own hands
and carry it on so quietly that nobody would know
what she was about. I wish I’d got it started before
Delavan appeared on the scene.”</p>

<p>“Delavan?” Hardaker repeated with sudden
interest. “Is his name Jefferson Delavan?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has a tobacco plantation down below
Lexington.”</p>

<p>Horace slapped his knee. “The same one!” he
exclaimed softly, and went on in reply to Dr.
Ware’s look of inquiry: “He’s the owner of that
slave they so nearly caught at Conners’ house this
morning, and he’s out with Marshal Hanscomb
following the fellow now!”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware pursed his lips in a subdued whistle.
“Then he’s likely to come to my house again
before he goes back. I’m sorry—he’s a taking
sort of chap, and Rhoda likes him.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sun was hot and Rhoda, on her homeward
way, slowed her horse to a walk and sought the
shady side of the road. Her thoughts were busy
with her mother’s recent pleadings and arguments.
A little frown wrinkled the wide space between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her level brows. “No,” she said to herself, “no,
father’s right about slavery—and mother’s wrong—she
doesn’t really know as much about it as he
does, although she did live there so long.”</p>

<p>Her thoughts lingered over the stories her
mother had told her of life on the southern plantations,
its gaiety and refinement and gracious
hospitality, and into her mind came the picture of
the Delavan home as she had seen it on a spring
afternoon of her childhood—the long, noble driveway,
tree-arched, up which the carriage swept, the
massive brick house with its wide verandas, half
hidden among trees, the carriage circling the great
lawn and drawing up at last at the steps, and Mrs.
Delavan coming eagerly forward to receive them,
her husband by her side and close behind her the
two children, Jeff and Emily. And then, of a
sudden, it was herself she saw in the mental picture,
with Jeff Delavan at her side, standing on
the wide veranda and welcoming their guests. A
smile flashed across her face and a tender light
shone in her eyes. “Oh, Jeff, Jeff!” she whispered.
“I do want to be your wife!”</p>

<p>She looked about her, a sweet longing in her
heart. Her horse was moving at a walk down a
long, sloping hill. Her eyes followed the road up
the opposite rise and she saw a man’s figure come
across the top and start downward at a run. She
wondered idly why any one should be running like
that on so hot a day. As they neared each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
at the foot of the hill she saw that he was a
mulatto, very light in color, but with negro blood
nevertheless plainly manifest in skin and eyes.
The thought flashed through her mind that perhaps
he was a runaway slave and at once her heart
warmed with compassion.</p>

<p>He was near enough to see the expression of
pity that swept across her face and he came toward
her with a half-wary, half-questioning look.</p>

<p>“What is it? Can I help you?” she asked
impulsively.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, Miss,—am I on the right
road to Gilbertson’s—is it much farther?” he
panted.</p>

<p>“About three miles, right on, along this road.”</p>

<p>“Three miles!” His face fell and despair
leaped into his eyes. He glanced at the trees which
thinly clothed the hillside. “Is there any place in
there where I can hide? Are there any houses—safe
ones?”</p>

<p>She bent toward him, looking straight into his
eyes. “Are you just running away from slavery?
Have you done anything wrong?”</p>

<p>He held her gaze unflinchingly as he answered:
“I’ve done nothing wrong—nothing but try to get
my freedom—but that’s the worst of crimes, south
of the Ohio River.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll help you. I know where you can
hide.” He assisted her to dismount and she
gathered up her long riding skirt and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
climb the rail fence. “There’s a cave over here a
little ways,” she went on. “I haven’t been there
for years, but I think I can find it. Yes, here’s
the path.”</p>

<p>“We must hurry,” he cautioned. “They’re
coming after me, and they’re not far behind. If
they turn off on that other road back there—I’ll
be safe—this time.”</p>

<p>She led the way and they walked on rapidly
through the straggling bushes and timber. The
hill was steeper here and the path sidled and
zigzagged toward its summit, for some distance
in view of the road. Halfway up the hillside it
made a sharp turn around a huge boulder and
plunged into a thicker growth of shrubs and young
trees. As the man, several paces in the rear,
reached this point he cast a quick glance at the
road and saw a horseman come into view across
the top of the rise.</p>

<p>He sprang forward, exclaiming in a shrill whisper,
“Hurry! My master is coming! I saw him
cross the hill!”</p>

<p>She drew her skirts higher and broke into a
run. “Did he see you?” she threw back at him,
and her swift glance caught sight of a pistol in his
hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Show me the cave, and then
you must get out of the way!”</p>

<p>“You won’t shoot him?” she demanded, turning
sharply round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“I will if I have to. I’m not going back into
slavery!” was his answer in a dogged voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_069.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“‘You won’t shoot him?’ she demanded, turning sharply around.”</p>

<p>They heard the neigh of a horse, over in the
road, and an answering call from Rhoda’s mare,
which she had left tied to the fence. “Are we
nearly there?” asked the mulatto.</p>

<p>The path sloped downward again and she sped
onward, her thoughts flashing, lightning like,
across her mind. If the slaves really did not want
freedom, if they were happy and contented in
slavery, why was this man taking such desperate
chances? Perhaps he was fleeing from a master
as cruel as Uncle Tom’s. She would ask him—at
last she could find out the truth from one of those
who alone knew what was the truth.</p>

<p>Rhoda stopped beside a thick tangle of hazel
bushes that grew against the face of a sharp rise
of the hill.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” she said. “Go around to the
other side of this thicket and between the bushes
and the hill just a little ways in, you’ll see the
opening into the cave. It’s perfectly safe—only
children ever go there.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, miss, thank you!” he breathed as
he hurried past her. Then he paused an instant
and half turned toward her again. “You’d better
get out of harm’s way, quick! If Jeff Delavan
did see me just now he won’t stop till he finds me,
if he has to burn the woods down to do it! And
I won’t be taken!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>He rushed on around the thicket and did not
see how she suddenly stiffened and the color faded
from her face, leaving it white to the lips.</p>

<p>“Jeff Delavan!” she repeated. “Is he your
master?”</p>

<p>The runaway was peering into the mouth of the
cave, making sure that the way was clear, but at
the amazed tone of her question he straightened
up, threw back his head and his voice was tense
with bitterness:</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, he is my owner—and also my
brother!”</p>

<p>“What!” Her horrified exclamation made him
look at her again more sharply and he saw a
scarlet flush mounting to her brow.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be surprised!” he went on hotly.
“It’s common enough in slavery. We had the
same father. Good-by, miss! God bless you!”</p>

<p>Still gripping his revolver he dropped behind
the bushes. Rhoda, intently listening, heard him
scrambling through the mouth of the cave. “Is
it all right?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the muffled reply.</p>

<p>“You can put up your pistol,” she went on, and
even the desperate fugitive huddled in the darkness
of the cave, the blood pounding in his ears,
was conscious of a sharp hardness in her repressed
tones that had not been there before. “I promise
he shall not find you!”</p>

<p>Rhoda sped back up the hill, at first conscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of little but a whirling in her head and a weight
like stone in her breast. As she neared the highest
point in the path she heard footsteps coming
toward her. Instantly her nerves seemed to
steady themselves and her mind grew clear. Holding
her riding skirt with one hand she began breaking
branches from the flowering viburnum that
grew thickly beneath the trees. So Jefferson
Delavan saw her as he hastily rounded the bend
in the trail beside the boulder.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” he exclaimed in joyful surprise, “you
here!” In his sudden lover’s gladness he did not
notice that there was no answering surprise in her
face. He sprang toward her, but she moved back
a step or two and shifted her handful of flowering
branches from the curve of her arm, holding it
between them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here—I—I wanted some flowers.”</p>

<p>His glance darted anxiously beyond, but came
back and rested upon her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Are you alone, dear? Is it safe? I thought
I heard voices just now.”</p>

<p>“You did,” she replied calmly. Her brain was
working clearly and rapidly now as her thoughts
flashed over what she must accomplish.</p>

<p>“Rhoda, you ought not to be here alone,” he
went on insistently. “You don’t know who may
be wandering through these woods.” Again his
glance left her face and swept the hillside. “I
am looking for a runaway now,” he pursued. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was sure I saw him on this path, just as he disappeared
among these bushes. Did you see him?
It was only a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him.” He stared at her, wondering
what might mean the little thrill in her tones.</p>

<p>“You did? Where did he go?”</p>

<p>“I shall not tell you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“I mean—I know where he is—I showed him
where to hide—and—I shall not let you find him!”
She had dropped her riding skirt and its long
black folds fell closely around her slender figure.
He stood a little below her on the hillside and as
he looked up and saw the calm determination on
her face, amazement overspread his own.</p>

<p>“Rhoda, you don’t realize what you are saying,”
he expostulated. “The fellow belongs to
me—he is my slave!”</p>

<p>Her face was white and stern and her eyes shining.
Even so had stood one of her foremothers,
generations agone, in Salem town, facing the charge
that her daughter was a witch. She drew herself
up and her lip, that short upper lip that he could
not see part from its fellow without a thrill in his
heart, curled scornfully. “He told me that he is
your brother,” came her swift reply.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment, his face flushing,
before he answered, a touch of indulgent wonder
in his tone: “And you believed him? You don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
understand how these niggers boast over—things
they know nothing about.”</p>

<p>She made a little gesture, as if passing by an
inconsequent matter. “It’s of no difference. You
shall not have him.”</p>

<p>Intensely annoyed though he was his heart
leaped toward her warmly, as she stood there
among the white viburnums, so tall and pale and
determined. That high and fearless spirit was
akin to his own and challenged his admiration.
But—this would never do—she must be made to
understand. He drew a little toward her again
and as she looked down into his face and read his
heart in it she felt her own stir in response.</p>

<p>“But, Rhoda,” his voice was tender and lingered
over her name, “you don’t realize what you are
doing.” Unconsciously her figure relaxed into
less rigid lines and within her breast she began to
feel a soft, insidious longing. “In hiding a runaway
slave you are disobeying the law—you are
guilty of a criminal act. The marshal and his
men were just behind me—they went down the
other road, but are coming back. They’ll be here
soon!”</p>

<p>“I shall not give him up—no matter what they
do—I shall not let you find him.” At that moment
she was seeing in her mind’s eye the pistol in
the fugitive’s hands and hearing his desperate
words, “I won’t be taken!” Her eyes fell anxiously
upon her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>They heard the clatter of galloping horses on
the road. “That’s the marshal!” he exclaimed.
“Rhoda, you must not let them find you here, hiding
a runaway nigger. I could not hinder your
arrest. They will take you to prison!”</p>

<p>She bent toward him, smiling gently. “Jeff”—she
began and an undertone of sweetness ran
through her voice that made his pulses leap—“are
you going to let them—find me here?”</p>

<p>For an instant he seemed about to leap forward
and take her in his arms. Then his body sagged,
he drew back and the protest of a strong man
whose determination has been bewitched away
from him was in his voice:</p>

<p>“Rhoda, you are taking advantage of my love!”</p>

<p>The smile that for him was always adorable
broke like a sudden illumination over her face,
shining even in her serious eyes and melting her
mouth, just now stern and scornful, into tender,
alluring curves. “Of course I am!” she agreed,
and added, as she glanced down demurely and up
again into his face, “And aren’t you going to let
me?”</p>

<p>A shout came through the woods from the road:
“Delavan! Are you there? Have you found
him?”</p>

<p>Jefferson Delavan searched for an instant in
his breast pocket as he called back: “No,—I’m
coming—wait for me—I’ll be there in a minute!”</p>

<p>He took out an old envelope and hurriedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
wrote a few lines on the back. “There,” he said
as he handed it to Rhoda, “is proof of my love.
I’ll send you the legal papers to-night.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat, bowed, and sprang down the
path. A moment later she heard him saying,
rather loudly, to the men at the fence, “No, we’ve
missed him somewhere. A lady is in there gathering
flowers and if he had gone this way she would
have seen him. Come, let’s hurry back.”</p>

<p>She listened to the sound of their horses’ hoofs
clattering up the hill and as it died away in the
distance she swayed against the tree beside her and
dropped her head into her hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>Through all the afternoon Rhoda stayed in her
room, thinking over her adventure of the morning
and considering whether it would be to her mother
or her father that she would tell the whole story.
Of one thing she felt sure—that she could not
marry Jefferson Delavan, that she could not be
the wife of a man who believed in slavery and held
slaves. To that decision had she come swiftly,
after her doubts and longings and vacillations of
the last week, while she listened to the departing
hoofbeats of the marshal’s party, going away
without the fugitive. To both, of course, she
would make known this determination, and to her
father she would tell the incident about the negro.
But she wanted to pour forth the whole affair to
some one who would understand and sympathize
and be tender with her because of the ache in her
heart.</p>

<p>Her mother would be sorely disappointed by
her final decision and shocked and grieved, if told
of it, by what she had done that morning and
would be able to see in the whole affair and in the
conclusion to which she had come nothing but
wrong-headedness and fanaticism. Rhoda knew
that she could depend upon her loving heart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
motherly tenderness and longed for her caressing
arms and her soothing voice. But she knew also
that Mrs. Ware could never understand why, if
she loved Jefferson Delavan, she would not marry
him, and she winced at the thought of what a
blow to her mother her refusal would be. Her
father would know just how she felt about it; he
would understand and appreciate the convictions
that had impelled her and he would be deeply
pleased. She knew just the light of satisfaction
that would flash into his eye. But he would not
sympathize or be tender with her unhappiness.
A touch of bitterness tinged her feeling as she
thought how different it would be were Charlotte
to go to him with a breaking heart.</p>

<p>Ever since her childhood had Rhoda stood thus
wistfully between her parents. Between her
father and herself there was always intellectual
understanding. Their minds worked alike and
they saw things in the same way, just as in facial
and bodily appearance there was much resemblance
between them. But it seemed to Rhoda that this
very physical and mental likeness had caused him
to hold her at a distance. Even as a little girl he
had never welcomed her affectionate advances as
he had Charlotte’s. She, on the other hand, had
always been drawn to him more than to her
mother, and she could still remember many a time
when, a little thing in pantalettes and short
dresses, she had slipped away with a trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
lip and hidden herself to fight back the tears which
would come because he had taken Charlotte up in
his arms and kissed her and had ignored Charlotte’s
elder sister. As she grew older they had
become good friends and she knew that he liked
to make a companion of her and that he talked
with her much more freely than with Charlotte.
But between them there was never any expression
of sentiment.</p>

<p>And now her aching heart was longing for
understanding, sympathy, tenderness, love, all
from one source, without having to make revelation
of itself. What she really wanted, although
she was not well enough versed in self-analysis to
know it, was something that would take the place
of the love she was casting aside,—or, more accurately,
that love itself. She came near enough
to such knowledge to say to herself, in the midst
of her unhappiness, “Jeff would understand and—and
be sorry, if I could only tell him all about
it!” And then she smiled, seeing the absurdity of
the idea. But notwithstanding her little flash of
amusement at herself she felt vaguely, in the background
of her woe-filled consciousness, that only
the supreme love between man and woman can
carry that full measure of comprehension, sympathy,
tolerance and affection for which human
nature forever yearns.</p>

<p>Finally it was to her father she went, when he
returned in the late afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I know you’re tired, father,” she hesitated at
the door of his office as she saw him stretched,
coatless, upon the lounge, “but I’d like to see you
a little while—and it’s important.”</p>

<p>“Come in, Rhoda. What is it? The Mallard
child? Not getting worse, is it?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s—it’s about me. I’ve made up my
mind to-day, father, that I won’t marry Mr.
Delavan.”</p>

<p>He sat up and across his face and into his eyes
leaped the expression of pleased satisfaction that
she had known would shine there at her news.
But all he said was:</p>

<p>“You’ve decided wisely, I think.” Nevertheless,
his professional eye had already noted the
signs still lingering in her countenance of her
afternoon’s vigil alone with her heart, and if she
could have known what compassion and tenderness
stirred in his breast she would have been surprised
and comforted.</p>

<p>“But that’s not all, father—such a queer thing
happened as I was coming home,” she hurried on,
trying hard to speak in a matter-of-fact tone.
Long ago, in her early girlhood, when she had
first discovered in her father an inclination to make
a companion of her, in her pride and eagerness to
be felt worthy of such honor she had unconsciously
begun to imitate toward him his own unemotional
manner toward her. And the habit had grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
upon her of thinking that in his presence she must
repress any show of feeling.</p>

<p>She told him in detail how she met the runaway
slave, how she secreted him in the cave and then
encountered Jefferson Delavan. But she glossed
over this part of the incident, saying only:</p>

<p>“And I told him at once I had hidden the man
and that I would not give him up, no matter what
the marshal might do, and when the men came and
called to him from the road he answered that the
slave wasn’t there and wrote quickly on an old
envelope an agreement to give the nigger his freedom.
He said he’d send the legal papers to me
to-night and then he took the others away, so that
they didn’t see me at all.”</p>

<p>She ceased speaking abruptly and silence fell
upon them. Dr. Ware was gazing fixedly at her
as he searched the meager words of her recital,
trying to find in them some revelation of what
really had passed between the two lovers. He
felt that there must have been some brief but
determined conflict of wills for the possession of
the slave, and he guessed that Rhoda had won
by feminine wile of love. The episode drove in
upon him the unwelcome conviction that the feeling
between them, notwithstanding the shortness
of their acquaintance, must be deep and genuine.
But he remembered how suddenly and irrevocably
he himself had fallen in love in the days of his
young manhood and, recalling certain indications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of character in Jeff Delavan’s countenance, he
thought uneasily, “I wonder if he’ll take ‘no’ for
an answer, after all.” He came back to her story.</p>

<p>“Did you give the agreement to the nigger?”</p>

<p>“Yes. After they were gone quite out of hearing
I went back to the cave and gave it to him and
told him to go on to Gilbertson’s and wait there
for the legal papers.”</p>

<p>“Good! That was the best arrangement to
make! If Delavan sends them as he promised
I’ll take them out to-morrow, when I go to Mallard’s.”</p>

<p>“And then he’ll be quite free, and out of all
danger?”</p>

<p>“Theoretically, yes, as long as he doesn’t lose
his emancipation papers. But if he is wise he
will get out of this free country of ours”—a
cynical bitterness sounded in his voice—“and go
on to Canada, where there’ll be no danger of his
being kidnaped and taken back into slavery.”</p>

<p>Rhoda mused for a moment “Father!” she
exclaimed suddenly, and in both voice and manner
he was aware of some new feeling and access of
energy that seemed full of significance. “What
do you think? Is this awful thing always going
to divide the North from the South? Are we always
going to hate each other like this? Is there
any help for it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Rhoda. Sometimes, when I
see how the North is forever knuckling under to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the South, giving up political supremacy and getting
more and more craven every year, I pretty
nearly lose all hope. I’m convinced that there’s
only one way out of it—we’ve got to fight. And
when we do fight the North will win, because we’ve
got more men and more money. The sooner it
comes the better, and I’m glad to see every new
insult the South piles on us, for if we’ve got any
spirit at all up here we’ve got to resent it some
day.”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked at him with intent eyes. His
tall, angular figure was full of energy, his eyes
sparkled and in his face shone the liveliest conviction.</p>

<p>“War, father! That would be so horrible!”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course it would. But it would end
the business. And slavery is one long, unending
horror.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is just what it is,” she assented
earnestly. “It is too horrible to think of!”</p>

<p>Again he gazed at her sharply, wondering
through what upheaval of emotion she had gone
that morning that had landed her so suddenly just
where he wished her to stand, when he had begun
to fear that her face would be turned the other
way. “That nigger this morning,” she went on
hurriedly, “he was a mulatto, said that he—he—was
Jeff’s brother! Only think of it, father!
What sort of an effect can slavery have upon a
man to make him willing to hold his brother as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
slave, a beast to be bought and sold! It’s too
horrible!”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware began to understand. Her lover
had fallen from her ideal of him and she was
casting the blame not upon him but back upon the
institution for which he stood. It was significant
of the complexity of his nature that, as he looked
upon her pale face, shining eyes and curling lip,
something akin to compassion for the absent
lover stirred within him, notwithstanding the bitterness
of his own feeling against slavery and all
it meant.</p>

<p>“Such things happen down south. I’ve known
some instances that were certainly true. But it’s
possible that sometimes the niggers boast when
they have no right to. As long as you have only
the runaway’s word for it, Delavan ought to have
the benefit of the doubt. The Lord knows he, or
any slaveholder, has enough to answer for, anyway.”</p>

<p>Rhoda scarcely seemed to hear him. She sat
silent for a moment and the animation faded from
her face. “The man had a pistol,” she presently
went on “and if Jeff—if Mr. Delavan—had found
him I’m sure he would have shot—to kill, rather
than be taken. He said he would.”</p>

<p>Her father bent upon her a puzzled look. Here
was still another factor in the motives, or the impulses,
which had moved her to action. How
much had she been impelled by desire to save her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
lover from harm and how much by the determination
to help the slave to liberty? He wished he
knew, so that he might judge just how deeply and
how permanently her renewed abhorrence of slavery
had taken root. He knew that if she went
into the Underground work he could depend upon
her to be loyal, capable and discreet, but he drew
back from asking her to take part in it unless she
could do so whole-heartedly with conviction as
intense as his own.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then, you saved his life,” he said
quietly, and then went on with a deeper significance
in his tone, “as well as got for the slave his freedom,
which is more than life to him.”</p>

<p>“Father, I want to do something!” she broke
out suddenly. “Is there anything a girl can do?
I know now that I can’t marry Mr. Delavan—I—I
love him—and if he wasn’t a slaveholder I’d
be glad to be his wife—and I know I’d be happy.
But I couldn’t—I just couldn’t feel myself responsible
the least bit for those poor creatures being
slaves. It’s wrong, father, it’s all wrong, and
horrible, and I won’t have anything to do with it.
I tried to think I could, for a while, because I love
Jeff so much and I wanted so to be his wife. But
this awful slavery would be between us all the
time—and I hate it, father, I hate it as much as
you do, and I want to do something to help put
it down!”</p>

<p>He looked at her with surprise, triumphant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
rejoicing in his heart. This was a different Rhoda
from any he had known. She sat still and spoke
quietly, but he saw that her hands were clenched
and in her low voice vibrated passionate earnestness.</p>

<p>The black face of the housemaid appeared at
the door. “What is it, Lizzie?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“A letter, sah, a big, fat letter, fo’ Miss Rhoda.
A boy brought it, jess now.”</p>

<p>Rhoda tore open the envelope, curiosity getting
the better, for a moment, of the feeling that had
just burst through all her usual barriers of restraint.
“It’s the papers freeing that slave!” she
cried. “It was good of Jeff to do this, wasn’t it,
father?”</p>

<p>Together they glanced through the document.
“I’m so glad I held out,” she exclaimed. “How
happy that poor man will be when he sees this!”</p>

<p>“You see, Rhoda, you’ve done something already!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I want to do more. Father, you do
something—I don’t know what—but I know you
work as well as talk. Can’t I help?”</p>

<p>She had never seen him look at her with such
pride and gratification. Her heart leaped in response
and she flushed with gladness.</p>

<p>“Yes, Rhoda, you can—I need your help. For
years I’ve given to the anti-slavery cause all I
could afford in money—mainly for the work of
the Underground Railroad. But I couldn’t do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
much in any other way because your mother’s
sympathies are with the South. Now the time has
come when they need my help as an actual worker.
You know Jim Conners’ house, not far from the
steamboat landing. For a long time that has
been the first station on the Underground Road,
for all the slaves who get across the river in this
vicinity. But Conners is going to Kansas soon
and, besides, he is under such suspicion and the
slave hunters are watching his place so closely that
it’s no longer safe. Why, this man,” and he
tapped the document, “was nearly caught there
this morning. He got away by the skin of his
teeth, in a dress and bonnet of Mrs. Conners’, and
the marshal and his men had been close at his heels
all the morning, when you came to his rescue!”</p>

<p>“Then you knew about him already!”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is, I knew of his narrow escape
this morning, and knew he belonged to Delavan.
Well, you see, there’s got to be a new refuge provided
for them here in town, not too far from the
river. For many reasons our house is the best
place possible. If you help me I think I can manage
it, with the aid of Jim and Lizzie, and your
mother and Charlotte need know nothing about
it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to help you, father, glad to do anything
I can, and it will be fine to know that we’re
getting even a few poor creatures out of slavery.
But, father, will it ever really amount to anything?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
She looked up at him anxiously. “Will
it ever help to tear out the whole wicked system?”</p>

<p>He glanced at her with approval. “I’m glad
you take that view of it, Rhoda. I’ll answer your
question in a minute. By means of the Underground
Road many thousands of slaves have been
enabled to throw away their chains. Levi Coffin,
in Cincinnati—you remember we were at their
house—has been engaged in this work for years
and himself has sent nearly three thousand runaways
on to Canada and freedom. The southerners
hate him bitterly and because of his activity
they call him ‘President of the Underground
Road.’ There is no president, no organization
of any sort, nothing but coöperation between those
who live near together. I speak of it to show you
how the work angers the slaveholders. They
got the Fugitive Slave Law passed six years ago
to try to stop it, and they are furious because it
has since flourished more than ever.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m coming to the point. As I told
you just now, I believe that nothing but war can
solve this problem. It doesn’t matter which side
begins it, just so the fight comes. If the North
won’t do it because of the South’s insults, then we
must make the South strike the first blow. She
must be irritated to the limit of endurance, and
this Underground work seems to me the most
efficient way of doing it. That’s chiefly why I’m
in it, Rhoda. It’s something, of course, to help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
individual slaves on to liberty, but I’m looking for
the big result. And I’ll be very glad to have your
help, so that I can begin to do something a little
more worth while. I’ve been waiting anxiously
for you to make up your mind about young
Delavan, for the situation here is important.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with wide eyes, her breath
coming fast. “And you never said a word to me
about it!”</p>

<p>He got up and took a turn or two across the
room. “Of course not. It was necessary for
you to fight the question out for yourself.”</p>

<p>They heard Mrs. Ware’s voice on the veranda,
softly calling Rhoda. The girl rose and started
toward the door, but stopped beside him.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, father.” Her head was held
high, her figure was erect and her young countenance
was almost solemn in its earnestness.
Half consciously she put out her hand. Instantly
her father gripped it and they stood like two men
pledging faith. It was the nearest they had ever
come to mutual expression of sentiment. Again
they heard Mrs. Ware’s voice, nearing the door,
and Rhoda, calling out, “I’m coming, mother,”
dropped her father’s hand and rushed from the
room before self-consciousness had time to mar
their moment of high resolve and close communion.</p>

<p>Dr. Ware gazed after her thoughtfully as he
sank into his desk chair. “Heredity was bound
to tell, sooner or later,” he said to himself, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
she’s got her full share of the New England
conscience. How that Puritan conscience does
flourish in the blood of us New Englanders, wherever
we go! In its original form I reckon it was
too strong a dose for the best results—a saturated
solution, it was then. But now it’s diluted enough
to be a first-rate general preservative of morals.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware drew Rhoda to her side with an arm
about her waist. “Jeff is here,” she whispered.
“He’s waiting for you on the front veranda. Go
up to your room by the back stairs, honey, and put
on your pink dress. It’s very becoming.”</p>

<p>When presently Rhoda came slowly downstairs
again and through the hall to the front door she
heard her mother saying to Jefferson Delavan, on
the veranda:</p>

<p>“Rhoda has some absurd, fanatical ideas about
slavery that she has got from her father, Jeff, but
I think you can hope for the answer you want.
And you know, my dear boy, how much I want you
to have it! I talked with her this morning—oh,
here she is now. Come, Rhoda, dear! Jeff is
waiting for you.”</p>

<p>She passed into the house as Rhoda stepped out,
grave and hesitant and gave him her hand. He
held it in his while his eyes studied her face with
anxious inquiry.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, and led her down the steps
and into the path to the grape arbor. She looked
pale and a little weary, but her serious gray eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
were very bright and in her face still lingered a
touch of the exalted mood in which she had left
her father. She tried to withdraw her hand
from his but he would not let it go, and after a
moment she submitted to the firm clasp in which
it was held. Once she lifted her eyes to his, but
at once turned shyly away, as if she could not
endure the look of love and yearning she saw in
them.</p>

<p>“Rhoda, you are like a wild rose, in that gown,
the sweetest of all roses.” He plucked a red rose,
the last one, from a bush they were passing,
touched it to his lips and handed it to her. “Last
week,” he said, “you gave me a rose for my
thoughts. Will you take this one for yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered gravely, “yes, I will tell
you—I must be very frank with you.”</p>

<p>They went into the arbor, where she sat down
on the bench and he stood before her, just as they
had done in the moonlight on that evening that
seemed now so long ago. The sun, drooping low,
sent level shafts of yellow light through the foliage,
which glowed darkly against the western brilliance.
They fell upon her fair hair and made
round her head a sort of aureole. Out of this
background her pale face and shining eyes, still
illumined by the high thoughts which had lately
filled her mind, looked up to meet the adoration
which beamed in his countenance. Unconsciously
the love-light leaped into her own eyes in quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
response, and for an instant they gazed deep into
each other’s hearts. Then he bent toward her
with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” he whispered. “You love me!”</p>

<p>As if suddenly roused from a dream she drew
back, and with one hand warded him away. “I
can’t marry you, Jeff, I can’t marry you!” she exclaimed
in hurried tones.</p>

<p>“But you love me, Rhoda,—I saw it in your
eyes! Don’t say you don’t!”</p>

<p>She straightened up and, watching her eagerly,
he saw the effort with which she regained her self-control.
“Listen, Jeff. Sit down here on the bench
beside me, and I’ll try to tell you how it is. I—I
do love you—no, don’t take my hand—don’t touch
me—I’ve loved you all the time. When you went
away, last week, I knew I was going to tell you
‘yes,’ sometime, but I just wanted to make you
wait a while—” She flashed her sudden, irradiating
smile upon him and he started forward and
seized her hand. She drew it away and went on
hastily:</p>

<p>“But I hadn’t thought then—I knew it of course,
but I hadn’t thought of it—I hadn’t thought of
anything but just you—about your owning slaves
and believing in slavery. And ever since I remembered
it I’ve been trying and trying to convince
myself that I wouldn’t mind, that I could make it
seem right—but it’s no use, Jeff. I can’t do it.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, puzzled, vainly trying to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
her point of view. “But, Rhoda, I can’t
see what difference that makes. If you love me
and I love you—and heaven knows I do, dear
heart—I can’t see why a matter of opinion should
keep us apart. Look at your father and mother.
He is violently opposed to slavery and she still
believes in it, and yet they loved and were married
and have lived happily together. Why can’t we do
the same?”</p>

<p>“But this is different. Mother just gave up
things she liked and the kind of life she enjoyed.
I could do that—oh, I’d love to do that, for you—for
any one I loved. But she didn’t have to become
part of something that she thought was wrong. I
can’t marry you, Jeff, because I know that slavery
is wrong, wicked, horrible, and I simply couldn’t
endure being part of it and having to uphold it.”</p>

<p>He rose and walked back and forth in front of
her. “This is your father’s influence,” he said
resentfully. “He told me that he would use it
against me.”</p>

<p>“No, you must not blame father,” she responded
quickly. “He has said very little to me about it,
and he told me that it was something I must settle
with my own conscience. And mother has said
everything she could think of to persuade me. I’ve
worked it out myself, and I know that I can’t
marry you—but, oh, Jeff! I want to be your wife
more than anything in the world!”</p>

<p>It was almost a glare with which he surveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
her as she uttered her last words. His hands,
hanging at his sides, were clinched. “Rhoda, this
is fanaticism gone mad!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She rose and stood before him. “You will have
to call it whatever it seems to you. To me it is
the command of my conscience, and I’ve got to
obey it.”</p>

<p>“Did that—incident—this morning have anything
to do with your decision?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Something, perhaps—no, I am sure I should
have seen things as I do now, anyway, after a
little. That only made me see the truth more
quickly and more clearly.”</p>

<p>“The truth?” he queried. “You mean—”</p>

<p>“I mean, it made me see that I could never regard
slavery as anything but wrong and monstrous
and criminal and that I could never, never make
myself a party to it.”</p>

<p>“But, Rhoda, this is absurd. You’ve never
lived in the South and you don’t know anything
about it. You don’t know how necessary it is for
us down there and how well it works out!”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to live there to know that it is a
wicked thing to buy and sell human beings as
though they were horses or pigs. But it’s no use
to argue about it, Jeff. You believe in it and I
don’t—I hate it, I hate it! And I wish I could
tear it down, myself, and destroy it forever!”</p>

<p>Her head was high, her eyes glowing and her
voice, low almost as a whisper, thrilled with passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
conviction. His eyes yearned over her for
a moment and then, “Rhoda! Rhoda Ware!” he
exclaimed. “You must be mine! I shall not give
you up because of this foolish notion of yours!”</p>

<p>She drew back and as she spoke she made evident
but unavailing effort to keep all feeling out
of her voice. “It’s no use for us to talk any more
about it, Jeff. My mind is made up, and I’ve told
you I can’t marry you. It only makes us the more
unhappy to keep on talking about it. I think we’d
better consider that it’s ended now, for good.”</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed. “It isn’t ended! As long
as you love me I’ll not give you up! I’ll go now,
but some day I’m coming back, and I’ll win you
yet, Rhoda Ware!” He seized her hand in both
of his and held it against his heart. Taken aback
by his sudden outburst she did not try to withdraw
it, but let him press his lips twice and thrice upon
it. Then, without another word, he strode out of
the arbor, down the path, and was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Dr. Ware noiselessly closed the door of his
wife’s bedroom and walked softly downstairs.
“Can we have supper at once, Rhoda?” he inquired
of his daughter at the door of the dining-room.
“Good! I’m called over to the other side of town
and I want to get away as quickly as possible.
It’s likely I’ll have to stay most of the night—maybe
until morning. Are you intending to go to
the party to-night?”</p>

<p>“I was, father, but if you’re going to be away
I’d better stay with mother. How is she to-night?”</p>

<p>“It’s the worst attack of sick headache she’s had
in a long time. But I hope she will soon be able
to go to sleep, and if she sleeps well all night she
will be much better to-morrow. She doesn’t want
anything now, but you might look in very quietly
after a little and see if she is asleep. Do you mind
missing the party?”</p>

<p>“No, not at all, father. But Charlotte—” she
looked uncertainly across the table at her sister.
“Do you think Charlotte better go without me?”</p>

<p>“Of course you do, don’t you, father?” Charlotte
promptly interrupted, with a coquettish look
at Dr. Ware, to which he responded with a fond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
smile. “Isn’t Horace Hardaker a good enough
chaperon for anybody?” she went on.</p>

<p>“Horace Hardaker!” her father exclaimed in
surprise. “What’s become of Billy Saunders?
Have you quarreled?”</p>

<p>“No—he hasn’t. He was impertinent this
afternoon—wanted to kiss me, and I told him he
shouldn’t speak to me for a month. So I asked
Rhoda if I couldn’t go with her and Horace.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware laughed indulgently. “Horace will
take good care of her, Rhoda. It’s all right for
her to go with him. But I’m surprised, Charlotte,”
he went on, frowning at her with mock
seriousness, “that a young lady of your convictions
should be willing to go to a party with a Black
Abolitionist!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid to let him go with me,
father?” she mocked in reply, her eyes dancing.
“Suppose I should convert him to slavery before
we get back, and make him promise to vote for
Buchanan!”</p>

<p>“You minx!” he said fondly, as he stopped to
give her hair a rumpling caress. Then with altered
manner he turned to Rhoda with some directions
for her mother’s comfort and messages for certain
patients if they should call during the evening.</p>

<p>The making of Charlotte’s toilette, at which
Rhoda assisted, was enlivened by much gaiety of
spirit on the part of the younger sister. Charlotte
had put aside the teasing humor in which she so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
often indulged and was more affectionate than
usual. Rhoda warmed to her in response and was
delightedly absorbed in helping to deck her for
the evening’s merrymaking. They laughed softly
together at her little flashes of fun, which were so
frequent that finally Rhoda exclaimed, smiling
down upon her fondly: “You’re hatching up some
mischief, sister, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Charlotte giggled. “Oh, I’m just thinking how
I’ll punish Billy Saunders!”</p>

<p>“And make him want to kiss you more than
ever!” warned Rhoda gaily.</p>

<p>“He shan’t, all the same!” Charlotte laughed
over her shoulder as she tilted out of the room.</p>

<p>From the veranda steps Rhoda bade Charlotte
and Horace Hardaker good-night, and as they
passed down the broad front walk between the lilac
hedges called out gay nothings after them and
laughed at her sister’s saucy rejoinders. When
they disappeared down the street she went back
into the house, softly humming to herself, for the
merriment still stirred in her heart. She peeped
into her mother’s bedroom and smiled with gratification
as she saw that the invalid was at last sleeping
soundly. Then she made a trip to the kitchen
to give Lizzie directions concerning breakfast and
afterward sat down in the living-room for a quiet
hour or two of reading.</p>

<p>It was in the early days of October, and the
presidential campaign of 1856 was at its height.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Mighty waves of political enthusiasm were sweeping
the country and stirring it to its depths, as
it had never before been stirred. The youthful
Republican party was already showing a marvelous
growth. From the South were coming open
threats of secession in case Frémont should be
elected.</p>

<p>Rhoda was intensely interested and under the
guidance of her father was eagerly following the
progress of the campaign. She sat down now with
a little pile of its literature on the table beside her
and took up first a pamphlet containing George
William Curtis’s oration on “The Duty of the
American Scholar to Politics and the Times.” The
quiet, intense conviction which glowed through its
polished phrases set her pulses to throbbing. She
read it through rapidly once, then went back and
studied carefully the arguments, breathing high
aspirations and noble ideals, by which he advanced
to the conclusion that the prime duty of the scholar
in that crisis was to work to his utmost for the
election of Frémont.</p>

<p>She knew that the oration was being read by
scores upon scores of thousands, for her father had
told her of its enormous circulation and of its
effect upon thinking people throughout the North.
Her hand trembled as she laid it down and went
out upon the veranda. She tried to form in her
mind some idea of all those masses of people
moved as she was feeling herself moved at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
moment by the orator’s inspiring sentences and
stirred as she was stirred by the desire to go forth
as to a crusade and with mind and heart and
hand work for the success of the party that would
put an end to the extension of slavery.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will surely be elected—he must be
elected!” she whispered, nervously clasping her
hands. Then she wondered, if Frémont should
be successful, would there follow secession and
war—the war which her father believed to be the
only means for the cutting of the Gordian knot
into which North and South had tangled themselves.
And then came quickly apprehensive
thought of that ardent and determined lover, on
the other side of the fateful river. She shivered
a little and told herself that the nights were already
growing much cooler. Presently she would
go upstairs, she thought, and, perhaps, she would
read again the letter that had come two days before
from Jefferson Delavan.</p>

<p>She went back to her reading and looked through
some recent newspapers. In the New York
“Times” she read an account of a great meeting in
Wall Street, where, from the steps of the Merchants’
Exchange, Speaker Banks, of the House of
Representatives, had addressed a mighty assemblage
of twenty thousand earnest men. In Pittsburg
had been held a monster mass-meeting of a hundred
thousand. Everywhere there had been meetings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
speeches, torchlight processions, bands, cheers, enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Rhoda had herself joined in that staccato cry of
the campaign, “Free speech, free soil and Frémont!”
only a few nights before when she and
Marcia Kimball and Mrs. Hardaker and others
of her friends had leaned from the windows of
Horace Hardaker’s office and with waving handkerchiefs
and responding cheers had added to the
enthusiasm of the Republican procession sweeping
down the street. Her father, heading one division
and Horace leading another, had saluted them with
waving torches and louder cheers. Her mother
and sister had stayed at home that night and
neither of them, by word or look, had shown afterwards
that they knew a torchlight procession had
taken place. But when the Democrats had had
their meeting and procession a week earlier Mrs.
Ware and Charlotte had gone under the escort of
Billy Saunders.</p>

<p>With close attention she read too of the great
meetings that were being held all over the North,
and the money that was being donated by rich and
poor alike in aid of the free-soil settlers in Kansas.
Recently she had had a long letter from Julia
Hammerton, Horace’s sister, giving intimate account
of the perilous times through which they
were passing and of the riot and pillage and
bloodshed which ravished the border. Her anxiety
for her friend doubled the interest with which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
perused the reports from Lawrence and Topeka.
She exclaimed with horror every now and then,
and at last with head bowed upon her clasped
hands she whispered: “Oh, God in heaven, grant
the election of Frémont, and stop all this, I pray,
I pray!”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“Inside were a withered rose and a letter.”</p>

<p>She sat musing for a while upon what she had
read, but her thoughts would wander to the grapevine
arbor, and again and again across the ardent
longings for the success of the Republican cause
which filled her mind would come the image of
Jefferson Delavan as he held her hand to his heart
and declared, “I shall win you yet, Rhoda Ware!”</p>

<p>A deep flush dyed her cheeks and muttering,
“Dear God, forgive me, that I cannot help thinking
of him even at such a time!” she rose and folded
the papers. Then she carefully put them away
in her father’s office; for Charlotte did not hesitate,
if she came across such publications in any
other part of the house and happened to be in an
audacious mood, to put them with laughing defiance
into the fire.</p>

<p>In her room she moved about restlessly, going
now and again toward her bureau, then turning
away. At last she opened one of the drawers and
from one corner hidden away under ribbons and
handkerchiefs, took a small box tied with a white
ribbon. For some moments she clasped it tenderly
in both hands, her eyes fixed on the floor. Then,
as she sank into a chair, the barriers of her will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
gave way and with trembling fingers she took off
the cover.</p>

<p>Inside were a withered rose and a letter. She
kissed the rose and caressed it in her palm and
held it against her cheek—had not he held it to
his lips that day in the arbor when she told him
she would not marry him? Then she unfolded
the letter and read again its brief sentences. Already
she knew them, every word, for in the two
days since she received it her traitor heart had
sent her, against her will, to read it many times.
It was dated in Cincinnati, where, he said, he was
likely to remain several days more, but before
returning home he intended to go on up the river
to Hillside, where he hoped to have the pleasure
of calling again upon Mrs. Ware and herself.
It was written in courteous, formal phrase, and
Rhoda’s eyes studied the lines as though searching
for some hidden expression of the love that she
knew was behind them.</p>

<p>“Ought I to write and tell him he’d better not
come?” she asked herself, as she had done a dozen
times already, but still unable to decide that she
would request him not to make the visit. Her
heart was longing to see him again, but what she
said to herself was, “It would be a disappointment
to mother if he should not come.”</p>

<p>Oh, traitor heart, that with its insidious desires
undermines the defenses of the will and levels to
the dust the walls of human determination! If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
wishfulness stand within the gate when temptation
knocks outside it is only the sternest “no,” to
both of them, over and over again, resolute and
unchanging and giving way not so much as a hair’s
breadth, that can save the day. If man’s desires
always squared with his knowledge of the right
perhaps the world would be a cleaner and a sweeter
place to live in. But it would lack the inspiring
savor of that grim struggle between them, as old
as the race, by which humankind has mounted a
few of the steps toward heaven. Man’s inability
to say “no” to himself, stoutly and often, is responsible
for more of his ills than is all “man’s
inhumanity to man.” And to dally with desire,
to argue with the traitor within the gates, to listen
for a moment to his specious pleading, is to make
it ever harder and harder to utter the one blunt
word that alone brings peace.</p>

<p>Doubtless Rhoda did not know, for she was not
much given to introspection, that if she did not
come to quick and sharp conclusions with the insurgent
within her own breast she was but lengthening
the conflict and making it the more difficult
to stand to the line she had set. She was quite sure
of her determination that she would not marry
Jefferson Delavan and she would have been amazed
and incredulous had any one told her that even by
this yielding to her love in the privacy of her own
room and debating with herself as to whether or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
not she should see him again she was throwing
doubt upon the issue.</p>

<p>So she sat there fondling the withered rose,
which his lips had touched, and the letter, which his
hand had written, and thinking that it would do no
harm if he should come again, for they would meet
hereafter merely as friends. Surely they were both
strong enough to be just good friends, and to keep
hidden whatever might be in their hearts. They
were so congenial, they enjoyed each other’s society
so much, why shouldn’t they have the pleasure
of meeting now and then? And her mother was
so fond of him, it really would not be fair to her
to tell him that he must not visit them. Yes, it
would surely be for the best, and to-morrow she
would ask her mother to write and say they would
be glad to see him whenever he should come. Her
heart gave a little bound at this victory and her lips
unconsciously formed themselves into the tenderest
of smiling curves as she pressed them upon the
withered rose. Then she put the box carefully
away, blew out her candle and knelt beside the
open window.</p>

<p>Her room was in the southeast corner of the
house, and the moon, dwindling past its half,
bounded up from behind the wooded hills and saw
upon her face the same tender look of smiling
happiness. Presently, upon the still night air came
the faint sound of cautious footsteps. She turned
her eyes, that had been brooding upon the star-filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
sky while her spirit wandered in dream-filled
Elysian fields, downward to the earth. She could
dimly make out a woman’s figure coming up the
middle of the street.</p>

<p>A lantern hung on one of the posts of the east
gate, beside her father’s sign. But it had now a
double purpose. Rhoda watched as the figure
came slowly on, stopped at the gate, glanced warily
about, and seemed to read the sign, “Dr. Amos
M. Ware.” By the dim light she could see that
the woman’s face was dark and that she held a
child by the hand. Instantly the girl’s spirit was
upon the earth again. With noiseless feet she
rushed downstairs, through her father’s office, and
out upon the veranda. The wanderer was climbing
the steps and looking doubtfully about, as if
uncertain what she ought to do next.</p>

<p>“You’re in the right place,” said Rhoda assuringly,
speaking barely above a whisper. “I
am your friend—come in.”</p>

<p>She hurried the woman into the office, pulled
down the shades and lighted a candle. Then she
saw that the fugitive, besides the child, perhaps
four or five years old, which she led by the hand,
carried a baby underneath her shawl. The girl
drew a swift breath that was almost a sob.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed, running to the woman and
putting her two hands gently upon her shoulders,
“Oh, you poor thing! You poor thing!”</p>

<p>The room occupied by Jim and Lizzie, the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
colored servants, was next to the office, at the
northeast corner of the house. Darting out on the
veranda again, Rhoda ran to their window and
rapped gently four times. In a few moments Jim
opened the door.</p>

<p>“Tell Lizzie to get up,” she whispered. “A
poor woman with two children is here. I’ve got
them in the office now, but you’d better let me
bring them into your room as quickly as possible.
They must have some supper and a little rest, and
then we’ll decide what’s best to do.”</p>

<p>Lizzie’s face appeared above Jim’s shoulder.
“All right, Miss Rhoda,” she was saying in subdued
but hearty accents, “you all kin come right
in—in two minutes.”</p>

<p>The runaways were soon eating a supper of cold
meat and bread and milk, which Lizzie hurried
into the room. Rhoda nodded and smiled at her
and her husband.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said coaxingly, “you and Jim will
let them have your bed a little while, won’t you?
Jim can go in the office and lie down on the lounge.
They must have some rest, for they ought to go on
to-night. It wouldn’t be safe to try to keep them
here to-morrow, for Charlotte would be sure to
discover the children. Father is not likely to get
back before morning—so I’ll drive them on to
Gilbertson’s. No, it’s all right”—as Jim made
a movement of protest. “Dolly is in the stable—you
can hitch her to the two-seated carriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
I’m not the least bit afraid, and it will be much
safer for me than you. Charlotte will be home
soon. We’d better not do anything more until
after she gets in and goes to sleep. But we ought
to start in about three hours. Have the carriage
ready, Jim, and I’ll be down. Now, you poor
thing, you and these babies must lie down and
get some sleep.”</p>

<p>When they were ready to start, Rhoda put the
child, still asleep, into a nest of rugs on the carriage
floor. The woman, with the baby hugged
to her breast, she took on the front seat. “If we
should happen to meet any one,” she said, “they’d
take less notice if we were sitting together sociably
like this. If you see father when he comes home,
Jim, tell him where I’ve gone. And, Lizzie, you’ll
be sure to look out for mother as soon as she
wakens in the morning, won’t you? If she asks
for me tell her I’ve gone on an errand for father.”</p>

<p>The street, going on northward, passed a few
more houses and then became a country road.
The Ware house stood on the top of a long, gentle
rise from the river. From the summit the road
dipped down into a shallow valley, then mounted
another longer and steeper ascent, whence it passed
into a region partly wooded and partly filled with
farms.</p>

<p>They drove on without speaking until they had
passed the last of the houses. Rhoda’s thoughts
were busy with the woman beside her, wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
what awful pressure of desperation had sent her,
with these little ones clinging to her hands, upon
the perilous road toward freedom. The fugitive
was a good-looking young mulatto, not much older
than herself. In her speech and manner Rhoda
had already noted the lack of a certain suppressed
fire which she had seen in some of the refugees,
and especially in the slave whose emancipation
papers she had won from Jefferson Delavan. In
this one there was instead a patient, pleading
resignation which seemed to her eloquent of the
wrongs of the helpless race. It appealed to her
from the big, mournful eyes of the child when,
mutely trustful, he let her take him from his
mother’s arm and lay him upon the bed. It was
tugging mightily at her heartstrings as they drove
down the dim road, her eyes on the faint track that
gradually opened out of the darkness. Her heart
was all one sweet compassion and brooding tenderness.
But she did not speak until they were well
past the last house of the town and beyond chance
of any wakeful ear.</p>

<p>“Have you come very far? Has it been hard?”
she asked in subdued tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, it’s seemed a long way.” The
woman used good English, and her gentle manner
showed that she must have been well trained. “But
I reckon it wasn’t really so far. It’s just a week
ago to-night that I took out. We’ve had to hide
in the daytime and walk at night, mostly. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
a man met us and hid us in a wagon under some
hay and took us right far. Sometimes I had to
carry both the children and then I couldn’t come
so fast. Andy was right good for such a little
fellow. He’d run most all the time. I told him
we were going to see his pappy and he’s been expecting
to find him every time we stop.”</p>

<p>“Your husband has got away, then? Is he in
Canada?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. He took out last June.”</p>

<p>“Did they follow you? Were you afraid of
being caught and taken back?”</p>

<p>“Eleven of us left at the same time, from three
plantations. We kept together the first night,
and then we divided. I wanted to come the same
way my husband had. The man who came down
there and told us how to go and what to do said it
would be safer for us to divide, and he said that if
I thought I could make the trip alone it would be
better for me, because they wouldn’t think I’d
leave the others. He told me not to be afraid, so
I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>The quick tears sprang to Rhoda’s eyes at
thought of this childlike trust and simple steadfastness.
“Do you know who the man was?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No, miss, I don’t know his name. He was a
young man and so kind looking you knew right
away that you could trust him. He came out
from Lexington about two weeks ago and we all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
thought he was just after birds. He wanted to
get bird skins and he paid some of the children
who could catch birds in snares, so the skins would
be whole. But after a day or two word was
whispered round that he wanted to see the slaves
who would like to be free.”</p>

<p>Rhoda nodded. “Yes, I know him! He was
here only a month ago, getting names of people
who would help the runaway slaves and what they
would do for them. He was at our house and
went right on down into Kentucky to let the slaves
know how they can escape from slavery. His
name is Alexander Wilson.”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. I didn’t hear his name. I’d been
powerful anxious to get away ever since my husband
took out, so I went to the meeting, in our
preacher’s house. The man had seen Andrew,
my husband, in Canada, and he had sent me some
money and word to follow him as soon as I could.
Oh, miss, he’s free now, and he’s earning money,
his own money, and making a home for us!”</p>

<p>For the first time in the woman’s simple narrative
the note of deep feeling broke through her
tone and manner of settled, mournful resignation.
The childlike wonder in her voice as she uttered
her last sentence touched her listener deeply.</p>

<p>“There are no slaves in Canada,” Rhoda said
gently. “You’ll be free too and perfectly safe
when you get there. What made you and your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
husband dissatisfied in the first place?” she continued.
“Did you have a hard master?”</p>

<p>“No, miss, he’s a right kind man to his slaves,
better than his sister. She’ll be married some day,
and we all thought the slaves might be divided
then and maybe some of us sold down south.” She
was silent for a moment, a suspended accent in her
voice, and Rhoda waited. “Master was always
right good to Andrew. There was a reason—”
She checked herself, as if some innate delicacy prevented
her from saying more, and went on: “But
Miss Emily would have sold him if she could.
She didn’t like him.”</p>

<p>“Miss Emily!” Rhoda exclaimed, a catch in
her breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, master’s sister, who has a share in
the slaves and everything. But Andrew’s free
now! He can’t be sold now!” Her voice was
full of happy satisfaction.</p>

<p>“But you’ll soon be in Canada, and then you’ll
be free too, just as free as he is,” Rhoda told her
assuringly, thinking that the slave woman had not
yet realized the freedom to which she was fleeing.
The girl spoke calmly and compassionately, but at
her heart there was a quick throbbing.</p>

<p>“I mean he’s surely free, miss! He’s got his
free papers! Master followed him and most
caught him, the man told me, and a young lady hid
him in a cave. Master Jeff came and she persuaded
him to give Andrew his free papers. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
miss! I wish I could see that young lady!” At
last the refugee’s feeling had broken through her
manner of subdued and patient resignation. Her
voice was trembling with eagerness and in the
moonlight Rhoda could see the tears rolling down
her cheeks. “I’d do anything for her, anything!”</p>

<p>A lump swelled in Rhoda’s throat. She leaned
forward to tap her horse to a faster pace along a
level stretch of road, then lifted her eyes to the sky
and whispered, “O God, I thank thee!”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” she queried as she leaned
back again.</p>

<p>“My name is Lina, miss,—Carolina, but I’m
always called just Lina. My husband’s name is
Andrew Delavan. We took master’s name.”</p>

<p>“Andrew is doing well in Canada, I think you
said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. He’s got some land and he’s building
a log house for us. It will be our own!”</p>

<p>“Well, Lina, I want you—can you write?—after
you get there I want you to write a letter to me—I’ll
write down my name and address for you—and
tell me about your home and whether or not
you and Andrew like being free. I think perhaps
I know that young lady you spoke of and I’ll show
her your letter. It will give her more pleasure
than anything else you could do.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p>It was still early the next day when Horace
Hardaker appeared at Dr. Ware’s east gate and
looked anxiously around for signs of life. After
a little he saw Jim at work in the stable and hurried
thither.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Jim! Is the doctor at
home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, I s’pose he is, though I hain’t seen
him. I reckon he’s heah, sah, for heah’s Prince
and the buggy he used last night. Do you want
to see him, sah?”</p>

<p>“Yes—no, that is—I reckon he didn’t get in
until pretty late?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you all are right, sah! I reckon it
must a’ been pow’r’ful late!”</p>

<p>“Then don’t disturb him now. I’ll see him
later in the day.” Hardaker turned and walked
a few steps, as if going away, his head bent and
his eyebrows wrinkled, then hesitated and came
slowly back. “Miss Rhoda—is she around anywhere?”</p>

<p>Jim came close and in low tones told briefly the
happening of the night before. “Miss Rhoda,
she hain’t got back yet and I’se begun to feel
anxious about her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“She probably waited at Gilbertson’s until
morning, and then stopped for breakfast. I dare
say she’s all right, but if you’ll saddle up Prince
for me I’ll ride out that way and make sure.”</p>

<p>Trotting along on the road toward Gilbertson’s
Horace Hardaker seemed to be uneasy of mind.
His brows were wrinkled, his lips pressed together,
and every now and then he made an impatient
exclamation. He was a young man, still under
thirty, but he had already acquired a good law
practice and was becoming noted throughout his
own and adjoining countries for his success in
jury trials. His sandy complexion, bright blue
eyes and the round, boyish contour of his cheeks
made him look even younger than he was. Countenance
and expression both indicated the emotional
temperament that was at the bottom of
his success in jury pleading. It rarely needed
more than three sentences of an address to the
twelve peers in the box to sweep him into the full
tide of ardent conviction of the merits of his case.
Whatever may have been his secret thought about
his client before, Hardaker always believed in
him enthusiastically by the time he had been talking
five minutes. Moreover, he was able, with
remarkable frequency, to make the jurymen believe
in him too.</p>

<p>Just now he was asking himself, “Shall I tell
her about it?” and the perturbation which the
problem caused him was evident in his countenance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
An uneasy shifting in his saddle and a
shake of his head showed that the telling, whatever
it might be, would be an ordeal from which
he shrank.</p>

<p>“But I’d as soon tell her as the doctor,” his
thoughts went doubtfully on, “and I don’t know
but it would do more good. Hang me if I don’t
need advice from somewhere inside the family!”
Another irritated exclamation broke from his
lips. But the impatience and anxiety of his manner
abated somewhat as he went on considering
whether or not he should confide his trouble to the
absent Rhoda.</p>

<p>“She’s got so much good sense,” he told himself,
“and she understands about things better
than most girls do, and there’s no nonsense about
her. She knows how to be a good friend too—I
reckon she and the doctor are the best friends
I’ve got, even if she won’t marry me—and that
makes it all the worse!” he exclaimed, looking
as if there were a bad taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>As he crossed the top of one hill he saw Rhoda
driving down the long slope of the next. With
a flourish of her carriage whip she responded to
his hat-waving salute.</p>

<p>“Let me hitch Prince on behind and get in and
drive you back,” he said, as they met at the bottom
of the hill. “So you had some U. G. baggage to
deliver last night?” he continued, as he jumped in
and took the lines from her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>She flashed a smile at him. “Yes, a trunk and
two handbags. And oh, Horace, they were the
wife and children of the man to whom Mr.
Delavan gave his freedom last June! I do hope
they’ll get to him safely!”</p>

<p>He remained silent, as he usually did if she
spoke in his presence of Delavan. So she turned
at once to another subject.</p>

<p>“How did the party go off last night? I didn’t
see Charlotte when she came home, so I don’t
know anything about it yet. Did you have a
good time?”</p>

<p>“The party? Oh, yes, it was pleasant. Everybody
seemed to enjoy themselves.”</p>

<p>She cast a side glance at him. He was looking
fixedly ahead and his expression seemed to indicate
lack of interest in the social function to which
he had escorted Charlotte. She tried another
tack:</p>

<p>“I spent the evening reading speeches. You’ve
read George William Curtis’s oration, haven’t
you?” He warmed up at this, with a look of
relief, and they plunged at once into a discussion
of the speech, comparing ideas upon it, and telling
each other bits of news they had heard about its
influence and about the progress of the campaign.</p>

<p>“When the state elections are held next week,
in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania,” said Hardaker,
“we’ll have a good indication of how things
will go in November. The side that gets Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
will be pretty sure to win. I hope we’ll
carry it, but between you and me, Rhoda, I don’t
like the look of things over there. They’re stealing
our thunder. They’re yelling ‘Buck and
Breck and Free Kansas’ all over the state. And
Kansas has about as much chance of becoming free
if Buchanan is elected as—Prince has of flying.”</p>

<p>“Has Julia said anything in her letters to you
about John Brown and what the free-state people
in Kansas think about him? You know the others
accuse him of most awful murders.”</p>

<p>“War is always murder, and it doesn’t pretend
to be anything else,” he responded with energy.
“The Buchaneers have been doing some atrocious
lying about him and about everything else out
there. According to them it’s war when the
border ruffians drive the free-state settlers out of
their homes and murder when Brown or anybody
else helps to defend the settlers from their attacks.
No, Julia hasn’t said anything particular about
him, but my opinion is that at the greatest risk to
his own life he’s helping to save Kansas from the
grip of the slave power.”</p>

<p>“Father believes in him,” said Rhoda thoughtfully.
“He knew John Brown here in Ohio, before
he went to Kansas and he says there is nobody
more devoted to the anti-slavery cause, or more
enthusiastic and unselfish. Charlotte was trying
to argue with me yesterday and telling me a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
stuff she had got from Billy Saunders about him.
But I never take Charlotte seriously.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte is very different from you,” said
Hardaker, gloomily.</p>

<p>“She’s different from all of us, except that I
think she must be like what mother was at her age,
only more—more of a mischief. The truth is,
Charlotte is dreadfully spoiled. We all spoil her,
and no matter what she does we laugh and say,
‘O, it’s just Charlotte!’—except mother, and
mother takes her too seriously, and that just makes
her try to be more provoking. She had it in for
Billy last night. Did she make him wish he’d
never been born?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t stop with Billy!” Hardaker exclaimed,
shutting his jaws with a snap.</p>

<p>His companion laughed. “Did she visit her
displeasure on you too? She made a sort of half
threat at supper about making you promise to vote
for Buchanan. I wonder if she did!” Rhoda
teased, her face rippling with smiles.</p>

<p>Horace looked full into her laughing face, then
turned his eyes suddenly to the front. “Hang it
all, Rhoda,” he broke out, “I must tell you about
it, though I’m afraid you’ll despise me afterward.
The truth is,—I suppose—I’m engaged to Charlotte!”</p>

<p>“What! You!” she ejaculated, her eyes wide
with amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes—I suppose so—something of the sort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Anyway, I made love to her”—his face was a deep
rose color and his eyes downcast—“pretty violent
love, I guess—at least I felt that way—and—well,
the upshot was that I suppose Charlotte considers
that we’re engaged. Oh, I know what you’ll think
of me, but I can’t help it now. I’ll just stand up
and take my medicine.”</p>

<p>As Rhoda listened, varying expressions flitted
across her face. Once, when Hardaker stole a
sidewise glance at her he saw there the stern look
her father wore when deeply displeased, and his
heart sank. But he went on stoutly. As he finished
her lips were twitching, then the corners of her
mouth went up, and she laughed aloud. At the
sound of her merriment he looked relieved, and
laughed a little too, though in a shamefaced way.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Horace!” Rhoda gasped. “Don’t
think me unsympathetic—but it was so like Charlotte!”
And she broke into another peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know what made me do it!” he
pursued. “Charlotte is a pretty girl, and good
company, and I like her well enough, but—you’ll
excuse me, Rhoda—I don’t exactly approve of her,
and heaven knows I don’t want to marry her.
That is, I don’t this morning, in cold blood. Last
night—well, last night, I felt different.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” agreed Rhoda. “I understand.
Charlotte usually can make a man ‘feel different’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
when she tries. And I guess she must have tried
real hard last night!”</p>

<p>“But that’s no excuse for me acting the fool,”
Hardaker responded gloomily. “And that’s just
what I did, Rhoda—egregious fool, consummate
fool, and every other kind of a fool you can think
of. Do you think she’ll want to hold me to it?”</p>

<p>Rhoda smiled and shook her head. “No, Horace,
I don’t. At least, not for very long. She
was probably flirting with you just to add to Billy’s
punishment. All she’ll want will be to get her
own little fun out of it.”</p>

<p>Hardaker brightened up. “She—she wouldn’t
let me kiss her! So I reckon she wasn’t in earnest.”</p>

<p>Rhoda laughed again. “Don’t feel worried
about it any more, Horace! It will all blow over
in a week.”</p>

<p>He looked at her gratefully. As she met his
eyes she saw more in them than gratitude. “Rhoda,
you’re the best girl out! I wish—”</p>

<p>She checked him with a warning hand. “Never
mind about that, Horace. Just start Prince up a
little faster, for I must get home.”</p>

<p>At that moment they came out upon the top of
the hill. Below them lay the town, its bowering
foliage dashed here and there, like an artist’s
palette, with splotches of brilliant color. Winding
between hills and fields, the noble river flashed
back the morning sun. Involuntarily Hardaker
checked the horse, exclaiming, as two river packets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
came sweeping around a bend below the town.
One of them was three or four lengths ahead of
the other.</p>

<p>“They’re racing, Rhoda! Just look at their
speed!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Horace! See the flames coming out of
their smoke stacks!”</p>

<p>“I reckon the firemen are just shoveling in the
resin, along with the coal, this time!”</p>

<p>“The one ahead is the ‘Ohio Beauty,’ isn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the other’s the ‘Northern Belle.’
Those two race every chance they get. The
‘Belle’ is trying to get ahead and beat the
‘Beauty’ to the landing, so as to capture all this
morning’s business. Look, Rhoda! You can
see them turning on the hose around the smoke
stacks, to keep the decks from taking fire!”</p>

<p>Both the steamboats were tooting their whistles
and ringing their bells, the shrill sounds of the one
eased a little by the sweet notes of the other.
Across the clamor broke faintly the music of the
bands stationed on their decks. Horace and Rhoda
could see the people on each boat waving hats and
handkerchiefs at the other.</p>

<p>“See the ‘Belle’ spurt ahead! She’ll get there
first yet if the ‘Beauty’ can’t get up a little more
steam!”</p>

<p>“And she is! Oh, Horace, see how the flames
are pouring from her chimneys!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Then, suddenly, the “Beauty” seemed to leap
from the water, there was a low, booming roar,
and out of a burst of flames and smoke her fragments
were scattered upon the bosom of the river.</p>

<p>For one instant the two watchers upon the hilltop
sat stunned and breathless. Then, “My
God!” muttered Hardaker as he leaned to urge
the horse forward.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Horace!” cried Rhoda. “We must
get father,—he’ll want to go at once!”</p>

<p>They dashed down the hill at a gallop, and up
the other side, and drew in at the Ware gate to
find the doctor, his razor in one hand and his face
covered with lather, trying to see from the
veranda what had happened.</p>

<p>They called to him, “A steamboat explosion!”
and he rushed back into his office, to reappear in
a moment with his surgical case and medicine bag,
wiping the lather from his face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>A swarm of rowboats was already picking up
survivors from the water, and the “Northern
Belle,” sure now of all the traffic there would be
that morning, slowed down and stood by until her
decks were crowded with the wounded, burnt, or
half-drowned sufferers.</p>

<p>Dr. Ware found a rowboat to take him out to
the Belle, still waiting in mid-stream. “Come
with me, Rhoda,” he said. “You can help.”</p>

<p>When the girl cast her eyes over the deck, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
she stepped on board, she shrank back, appalled
and sickened by the ghastly sight. But with a
tightening of the lips she drew herself together
and went to work. Presently, as she was trying
to quiet an hysterical woman, her father came
close and drew her aside.</p>

<p>“Rhoda,” he said in a low voice, “Jeff Delavan
has just been brought on board.” She turned
pale and swayed toward him and he grasped her
arm. “Steady, girl,” he encouraged. “He’s
alive, but unconscious. As far as I can see now
I don’t think he is seriously injured. Your
mother would probably want him taken to our
house.”</p>

<p>She straightened, with a quick grip upon herself.
“Yes, father, of course she would—and I,
too. Oh, he shall go nowhere else!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p>So it happened that when Jefferson Delavan
came back to consciousness Mrs. Ware was bending
over him, extreme anxiety in her look. Dr.
Ware had found that his manifest injuries consisted
in a broken rib and some burns upon his
arms. But an accidental blow while clinging to
a plank in the water had rendered him unconscious
and he had been rescued barely in time to
prevent him from slipping off and sinking to his
death. Over the possible results of this blow the
physician was anxious. Everything would depend,
he had told his wife and Rhoda, upon how
the young man came out of the oblivion. He
had warned them that it might be with wandering
wits, and in that case only time could tell how
severe, possibly even how permanent, would be
the results of the accident.</p>

<p>Delavan stirred and moaned slightly and Mrs.
Ware, bending over him with her fingers upon
his pulse, saw that his eyelids fluttered. “Rhoda!”
she called, her voice a-tremble and sinking to a
whisper, “he’s coming to!” Rhoda, leaning
across the foot of the bed upon her clenched hands,
was watching his face with intent eyes.</p>

<p>“Come and stand beside me!” her mother went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
on with quivering lips. “If he shouldn’t know
me I—I can’t stand it!” Rhoda took his wrist
from her shaking hand, pressed firm fingers upon
his pulse and threw her other arm with a little
soothing caress around the elder woman’s shoulders.
Suddenly the patient’s eyes flew open and
with a bewildered stare looked up into Mrs.
Ware’s pale and anxious face.</p>

<p>“Jeff, dear boy, don’t you know me?” she
begged. His blank, unrecognizing gaze rested
upon her for a silent minute, then wandered on
and fell upon her companion.</p>

<p>“Speak to him, dear,” Mrs. Ware whispered
brokenly. But there was no need. Slowly a
puzzled expression crept into the vacuity, and that
presently gave way to one of recognition, and then
the hearts of the two women were stirred to their
depths by the glad wonder that illumined his
countenance. Never would Rhoda be able to
forget that look, like the sudden happiness over-spreading
the face of a child at unexpected sight
of a loved one, which her presence had inspired—her
presence, which had brought back his sense,
trembling upon the verge of that unknown black
gulf, into the world of light and reason.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” he said feebly, and then, smiling,
closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>“Stay here beside him,” Mrs. Ware whispered,
“while I go and see if your father has returned.
Oh, honey! I think it’s going to be all right!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>When she came back with Dr. Ware, half an
hour later, she slipped quietly into the room a few
steps ahead of her husband and found Rhoda telling
her patient what had happened, while he listened,
with her hand clasped in his. Her motherly
heart gave a quick throb. “It has brought Rhoda
to her senses too, at last!” was her quick inference.
But a moment later doubts disturbed her certainty
as she saw the unconcern with which the girl withdrew
her hand and made way for her father.</p>

<p>Dr. Ware was well pleased with the young
man’s condition. “You’ll have to stay in bed a
few days, perhaps a week,” was his decision,
“while your broken rib is knitting itself together
again. You’ve got a pretty good case of nervous
shock also, as the result of that blow on your head—and
you can thank God, Mr. Delavan, that it’s
nothing worse than shock. But a few days of
quiet will make that all right too.”</p>

<p>There was no perturbation in the physician’s
mind, at first, over the presence of Jefferson
Delavan in his house, invested though the young
man was with the romantic interest of his narrow
escape from death. He felt sure of his daughter
now and did not believe there was any danger of
her marrying the southerner. She had thrown
herself unreservedly into sympathy with the anti-slavery
cause and she was working with him
enthusiastically and efficiently in making of their
house a “station” on the Underground Railroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“No,” he assured himself, “she won’t go back
on her convictions now. She’s decided what’s
right for her to do, and she’ll stick to it like a
soldier.” He smiled with pride, but a moment
later his thought supplemented, with softened
feeling, “It will be hard on her, though!”</p>

<p>On the whole, feeling thus sure about Rhoda,
he was rather glad to have the young man there,
because of the pleasure it would give his wife to
mother him and to recall the memories of her
youth. In Dr. Ware’s feeling toward his wife
there was a strong element of compassion. In
serious middle age, considering the past with judicial
mind, he doubted not a little if, in that wildly
impelling time of youthful passion, it had been
quite the fair thing for him to marry her and take
her away from all her girlish associations. He
knew well enough that she had loved him then
and that she still loved him and that their life
together had been as calmly happy as imperfect
mortals have any right to expect the wedded state
to be.</p>

<p>But he also felt quite sure that if he had not
paid impetuous court to her in those vivid youthful
days she would have loved and married some
man of her own region and lived her life surrounded
by the conditions and the people with
whom she was most in sympathy. His conviction
that she would have been happier in such estate
inspired him with a very great tenderness toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
her, and with a half-realized wish to make atonement,
in such little ways as became possible, for
what she had missed.</p>

<p>She had been loyal to him through all these
years, and from the start had refused to go back
to her old home for even a short visit, because the
invitations from her family had never included
him. That one stay at Fairmount, with Jeff
Delavan’s mother, had been the only return to the
old life which she had ever allowed herself. So
now he was pleased when he foresaw how much
comfort she would find in having “Adeline’s boy”
under her roof and needing her ministrations.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ware had still another reason to be
pleased that Jeff Delavan was to be a member of
their household for several days and under such
conditions. She warmly hoped and therefore almost
believed that Rhoda’s determination would go
down under the persuasive influence of daily association
with her lover. The girl was a good nurse.
She had considerable knowledge, acquired from
her father, of what ought to be done in a sick-room
and she was one of those people with a
native knack for making an invalid comfortable.
Therefore, Mrs. Ware argued, it would be her
duty to take main charge of their bedridden guest,
and Rhoda would do it if she could be made to
see that it was her duty.</p>

<p>There was nothing so sure to soften a girl’s
heart, she told herself, as seeing a strong man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
dependent upon her care. And this combined
with Jeff’s masterful love-making and the pleadings
of her own heart—could there be a better
combination? Truly, it was almost providential,
Jeff’s being upon that boat.</p>

<p>She began at once to plan the household matters
so that Rhoda would be free to devote the
greater part of each day to the sick-room. She
decided also that it was most necessary for the
patient to be kept quiet, to be undisturbed by much
going in and out of his room, and that therefore
Charlotte, at least for several days, should not be
admitted.</p>

<p>Charlotte keenly resented this order. She felt
it to be most unfair that she, who would undoubtedly
be to any young man the most entertaining
member of the family, should be barred from a
room so full of romantic interest as this, in which
lay a good-looking young gentleman, who had
barely been rescued from a tragic death but who
doubtless would still be capable of good judgment
in the matter of feminine attractions. When
Rhoda found her at the piano practising “The
Last Rose of Summer” in the late afternoon of
that first day she was looking very glum.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, sister?” Rhoda queried.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Charlotte answered shortly.</p>

<p>“Really? I’d never think it!” Rhoda smiled
at her, sitting down with a lapful of stockings to
be sorted into goats-to-be-mended and sheep-not-to-be-mended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
“If I were going to guess, I’d say
you were sleepy and needed to go to bed early.
I heard you come in last night, and it was pretty
late. You haven’t told me a word yet about the
party. Did you have a good time?”</p>

<p>Charlotte laughed and tinkled some notes upon
the piano keys. “Yes, indeed! I haven’t had
such a perfectly lovely time in I don’t know
when!”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” Rhoda smiled discreetly, her
eyes upon her work. “And Billy—did he have
a good time too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy! Rhoda, you ought to have seen
him! He was just furious! He looked as if he
wouldn’t want to speak to me for a month. But
he will!”</p>

<p>“You haven’t said anything about Horace. Did
he enjoy the evening?”</p>

<p>Charlotte, with her eyes on Rhoda’s face,
opened her lips to make a merry answer, hesitated,
then darted at her sister a searching glance.</p>

<p>“Rhoda,” she exclaimed, “Horace has been
telling you about it!”</p>

<p>“About what?” Rhoda looked up, the suspicion
of a smile at the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>“O, la! About <i>it</i>, I said, didn’t I? Oh,
Rhoda, it was such fun!” Charlotte’s voice was
suffused with laughter. “But it’s nothing to make
Horace propose. Why, Rhoda, you could do
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Rhoda laid her stockinged hand, in whose covering
she was searching for possible holes, in her lap
and turned serious eyes upon Charlotte’s face,
alight with merriment. “Do you really think so,
sister? But, then, I don’t think I should want
him to.”</p>

<p>Charlotte looked at her in surprise. “You
wouldn’t, Rhoda? That’s queer! But you are
queer, anyway! The first thing we know you’ll
be wearing short hair and bloomers and going to
woman’s rights conventions! But please don’t,
until after I’m married, anyway, so I won’t belong
to the family any more!”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to marry Horace right away
I shan’t have to wait very long, shall I?”</p>

<p>“Who said I was going to marry Horace? Did
he?”</p>

<p>“No. He said he—hoped you wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>They both laughed and Charlotte went on, with
a saucy toss of her head: “Oh, he did, did he! He
ought to be punished for that! Rhoda, I’m going
to tell him he’s either got to keep his promises or
vote for Buchanan! You know, I’m awfully
fond of Horace”—her mouth drooped and her
voice was plaintive—“but I’d be willing to give
him up for the sake of a vote for Buck!”</p>

<p>“Poor Horace! You ought to be ashamed to
tease him so!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you don’t want him teased, I’ll
tell you what I’ll do.” She stooped to pluck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Bully Brooks, now verging fast upon the dignity
of cathood, from the comfort of a nap upon a
chair. “If you’ll persuade mother to let me go
in to see Jeff Delavan whenever I want to I’ll let
Horace off. But if you don’t he’ll have to either
marry me or vote for my side. Won’t he, Bully
Brooks?”</p>

<p>The response of the kitten was of such emphatic
sort that she boxed its ears and threw it to the
floor. “The kitten’s getting too big to be teased,”
Rhoda commented quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, Horace isn’t!” she responded saucily
and went whistling from the room.</p>

</div>

<p>“No, mother, I don’t think I ought to do it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Rhoda, what a curious idea! It seems
to me to be plainly your duty. Jeff is so much
quieter and more contented when you are in the
room.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t seem quite right to me to stay
there so much when I’m not going to marry him.
I know he—still loves me and if I spend so much
time with him he’ll think I’m just leading him on
to make him ask me again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware smiled at her daughter and fondly
patted her arm. “My little Puritan girl! No,
honey, Jeff is a gentleman and he won’t think
anything of the sort. It’s very wrong of you to
let such silly scruples hinder his recovery. Just
think how fortunate it was that you were there
when he came to himself yesterday! Why,
Rhoda, I told your father it was just as if the
sight of you fairly pulled him into his right senses.
And now he’s nervous and fretful if you stay out
of the room very long, as you did this afternoon.
That’s bad for him, Rhoda, you know it is. He
needs to be kept contented and happy.”</p>

<p>Rhoda turned to the window and looked
thoughtfully out. They were in her mother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
bedchamber, on the western side of the house.
The sun was sinking into a royal couch of red and
gray and gold, amber and pink and purple. Its
level red rays fell upon the arbor and touched the
withering leaves with delicate, evanescent tints.
Her thoughts went back to that June night and
she seemed to sense again the fragrance of the
white petunias and to feel that prescience of fate
awaiting her in its heavy shadows. And then
with a rush that set her heart to beating faster
came the thrilling memory of love words and the
knowledge that had been born in her breast. Mrs.
Ware noted the direction of her eyes and saw the
quickening of the faint rose-bloom in her cheeks.
She guessed what was in her daughter’s mind,
smiled, and kept silent.</p>

<p>That there was truth in what her mother said
about her influence in the sick-room Rhoda was
well aware. She had herself noted their patient’s
increased nervousness if she stayed long away from
his presence, and she treasured the thought of it
in her heart as she did his open words of love.
And she longed, far more than even her mother
could guess, to be there with him, to minister to
his comfort, to hear his voice, to catch now and
then the look of love in his eye. So much did she
yearn for all the blessedness of it that she was
afraid to trust herself, afraid for her resolution.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes away from the grape arbor
and deliberately fixed her thoughts upon the slave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
woman and her two little children whom she had
succored two nights before, forced herself to think
of the dozen others whom she had helped to conceal
in the house and to further secretly on their
way, of the desperate, fleeing bondman whose
freedom she had won from Jefferson Delavan in
the woods on that June afternoon.</p>

<p>With a sudden indrawing of her breath she set
her teeth upon her lip and said within herself,
“No, no, I will not fail you!”</p>

<p>But the dear thought of her lover and his need
of her still drew her heart. Well, she would tell
him there must be no more of love between them
and that only upon that understanding would she
stay beside him in his sick-chamber. Then he
could have no false hopes and the way before them
would be fair and clear. At this capitulation she
was conscious of a thrill of happiness and she
could not resist dwelling for an instant upon a
sweet premonition of their hours together. Just
then she saw Charlotte down in the yard and her
sister’s proposal of the day before recurred to her,
as it had already done several times. She knew
there was no telling how far Charlotte might
choose to carry her teasing of Horace Hardaker.</p>

<p>“Poor Horace! It’s a shame!” was her
thought, but a smile went with it. “Such a good
friend as he is, and he does take things so much
in earnest!” Why shouldn’t Charlotte go in and
out of the room as freely as she did? The idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
brought a sharp pang with it—Charlotte had
such a way with her, and if she chose—well, what
right had she herself to Jeff’s love when she would
not marry him? What a mean thing it would be
to stand in her sister’s way if Jeff should choose
to transfer his affections. Something seemed
clutching at her heart, but she turned quickly
round to her mother, who had been waiting with
a pleased smile on her face, scarcely doubting
what would be the result of her daughter’s few
minutes of thought.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ware had not yet learned, although
Rhoda had been giving her constant proof of it
for more than twenty years, how different were
their viewpoints, their modes of thought, the results
toward which their temperaments bade them
aim. Rhoda was always surprising and disappointing
her, and yet she had such faith in Rhoda’s
good sense that she could never believe, beforehand,
that the girl would fail to see things just as
they appeared to her. And one such surprise was
even now awaiting her.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right, mother, and I’ll do as
you like about it, only it seems to me that Charlotte
ought to go into the room as much as I do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware looked at her daughter in blank
surprise. “Charlotte! Why, Rhoda, that would
be the greatest mistake! You know how trying
Charlotte is, and Jeff needs rest and quiet!”</p>

<p>“His nervousness won’t last long, and it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
good for him to have some one there as lively and
entertaining as Charlotte is. It doesn’t look,
right, mother, it isn’t quite nice, when there are
two of us, to allow only one to go inside his room.
I’ll be chief nurse if you want me to,” and she
flashed her sudden smile upon her mother, “but
I want Charlotte for my assistant.”</p>

<p>And finally, with many misgivings and much
inward wondering why Rhoda did not know
better than to give Charlotte such an advantage,
Mrs. Ware gave up her determination. And
Charlotte, her eyes sparkling over the triumph
she had gained and her cheeks glowing with
pleased excitement, helped Rhoda to take in the
invalid’s supper.</p>

<p>The next day they were both in Jeff’s room,
Rhoda with some sewing at which she worked
while all three talked and jested together. But
Charlotte was making much pretense of putting
things to rights. She was of small stature, like
her mother, and had a dainty figure, supple and
well rounded. It showed to best advantage when
she flitted about, as she was doing then, with
quick, graceful movements, her body seeming to
take unconsciously just the right poses and her
arms and neck and head to move as if with some
pleasing rhythm. Rhoda, who was tall and inclined
to thinness and had long arms, knew with
inward bitterness that when she moved about a
room it was with no such pleasing effect. As she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
glanced now and then at Charlotte she could not
keep a touch of envy out of the admiration with
which she regarded her sister.</p>

<p>Charlotte noted her side glances, made instant
inference as to their cause, and at once became
busier than ever. She had a way of tilting her
hoopskirts as she walked, of which her mother
had voiced frequent disapproval, so that with
every step they showed her feet and ankles, and
seemed to emphasize the grace and daintiness of
her figure, with whose movements they swayed in
harmony. The accomplishment had cost her a
deal of practice before her mirror, and she usually
reserved its exercise for occasions when she
wished to be especially provoking. But she began
it now, although her mother was not present,
and tilted back and forth across the big room,
tossing every now and then to Jeff Delavan a
smile, a saucy look, a laugh, or a gay rejoinder.
His eyes followed her and he joined in her gaiety
with evident entertainment. A dull, pained foreboding
began to creep into Rhoda’s heart, but she
said firmly to herself, “It’s all right, whatever
happens, for if I won’t marry him I’ve no right
to try to keep his love,” and held it down and
laughed and talked with them.</p>

<p>After a little Mrs. Ware came in for her morning
call upon her “dear boy” and when she left
the room she summoned Charlotte to go down the
hill upon an errand for her. As the door closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
upon them Delavan turned to Rhoda with a
smile.</p>

<p>“What a spoiled child that little sister of yours
is!” he said. “I rather think she needs a lesson,
and some of these days she’s bound to get it. It’s
to be hoped,” and his voice became gentler, “that
it won’t be too hard on her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve an idea,” Rhoda replied, “that
Charlotte would be pretty well able to take care
of herself and would be likely to give back a
better lesson than she got!”</p>

<p>He gazed at her a moment in silence, and she,
seeing the look that was coming into his eyes,
turned her attention to her sewing and tried not
to feel the trembling in her bosom and the warming
of her cheeks. “How loyal you are, Rhoda,”
he said presently, “except to your own heart—and
to me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Jeff! Please don’t say those things
to me any more! I mustn’t listen to them, no
matter how much I’d like to, for I’m not going
to marry you—you know that. Give it all up,
Jeff, and let’s see if we can’t be just good friends!”</p>

<p>“No,” he broke in, “I shall not give it up, as
long as I can see and hear in your eyes and your
voice that you love me! You’ve no right, Rhoda,
to deny your heart and mine like this!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jeff, I’ve gone over that, and over and
over it, so many times with myself, and there’s
only one right way, the way my conscience points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
out to me! I can’t marry you, Jeff, I can’t, and
that’s all there is about it! It’s only painful to
us both to talk about it, so please don’t do it again!
We enjoy each other’s society so much, both of
us, so let’s just have what comfort we can out of
being together while you’re here, and not spoil it
by talking about what can’t be!”</p>

<p>“It’s because we love each other, dear heart,
that we like being together! Oh, Rhoda, if
you’d only admit—”</p>

<p>She bent toward him with her sudden, flashing
smile, that he had come to know as the signal of
some equally sudden and unexpected face-about
in her thought, and he stopped, expectant.</p>

<p>“I do admit it, Jeff!” came to him demurely in
the wake of the smile.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” he cried, and his whole being tried
to leap toward her. But he had no more than
lifted his head from the pillow than she sprang
up with a cry of alarm, her hand thrust out to hold
him back.</p>

<p>“Jeff, you mustn’t!” she exclaimed, her face suddenly
serious again and her voice all anxiety.
“You’ll break that rib over again if you don’t lie
still, and father says it’s knitting together so
nicely!”</p>

<p>In her alarm she had put one hand against his
chest to push him back upon his pillow. Quickly
his hand imprisoned it and held it against his
heart. For a moment neither spoke and as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
bent above him feeling his heart throb beneath her
hand, looking down into his eyes and seeing love
and longing there, response crept into her own
and a warmer color into her cheeks. Unconsciously
she bent nearer, swayed toward him, and
he threw up both arms, sure that they would enclose
her in the embrace for which they were
longing. But realization flashed upon her and
she sprang back. He held his empty arms toward
her for a moment, then let them fall upon the
bed. She could not bear the look upon his face
and sank down into her chair, her own hidden in
her hands.</p>

<p>Presently she began gathering up her sewing,
scattered upon the floor. “Rhoda,” he said
humbly, “I beg your pardon!”</p>

<p>She would not meet his eyes, but kept her own
steadily upon her sewing, as she neatly folded it
together. “It wasn’t your fault any more than
mine,” she answered in subdued accents, “but it
mustn’t happen again, or I shall have to stay out
of here entirely. I must go now. Father is usually
home by this time, and I always go to his
office when he comes to see if he needs me for
anything.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll come back, dear, as soon as you
can? And you’ll forgive me?” he begged.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll come back, when I can, but I’ll be
busy now, for a while. And I’ll forgive you—if
you’ll forgive me!” She smiled at him, not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
radiant flash which he loved, but just a tender
curving of the lips which sent no merry light up
into her serious eyes.</p>

<p>“Rhoda! What a dear girl you are! Forgive
you! You’ll come back soon?”</p>

<p>“As soon as I can.” She turned at the door,
still smiling gently, and held up at him a warning
finger. “But you must promise not to talk about
love!”</p>

<p>“All right, Rhoda. If you won’t stay away
long, I’ll promise—for next time!”</p>

<p>Outside the door a trembling seized her and
she leaned against the wall. “I didn’t give up,”
she told herself, “I didn’t, that time. But could
I—again?”</p>

<p>She went into her own room and knelt beside
the window, whence, a few nights before she had
seen the mulatto refugee and her babies come
trudging up the street. Vividly the picture came
before her mind and with it once more the thought
of all that such a flight must mean to a woman,
alone and in the dark, with two helpless children,
herself almost as helpless as they. She bowed
her head upon the window sill and whispered:
“O God! Dear God in heaven, give me strength
to keep myself away from that accursed thing!
Save me from my own heart, which tempts me so,
and keep me, O God, keep me from giving up!”</p>

<p>When she rose from her knees, she did not go
at once downstairs, but moved about the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
doing little things that did not need to be done,
straightening a pillow on the bed, moving a chair,
raising the window shade, then lowering it again,
rearranging the things on her bureau. And at
last, irresolutely, she opened a drawer and took
out the little box tied with white ribbon. She
held the withered rose in her palm, kissed it, and
said softly, “Good-by, dear love, good-by.”</p>

<p>Perhaps she believed at that moment that she
would never again allow herself to caress and to
brood over this little symbol of her love, that she
would never again give up to her heart even in a
privacy where none but herself could know that
she had yielded. But she carefully put the box
away again in the same hiding place, which she
knew so well that her hand could go straight
thither with her eyes shut. For her years numbered
but two and twenty and they had fallen
from her along an easy path, marked as yet by
struggles too few to have taught her that God
helps only him who helps himself to the uttermost,
and that perhaps far more of God is in his
own strivings than in the distant heaven to which
he prays.</p>

<p>On the stairway she met her father. “I’ve
been looking for you, Rhoda,” he said. “Come
into the office.” There he carefully shut the
doors, after a hurried glance round about. “I’ve
just had a letter,” he went on in a lowered voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
“from Alexander Wilson. You remember him,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father. The young Canadian who was
here a month or so ago, to study the Underground
Road, and went on south to stir up the slaves.
Did I tell you that the woman I took to Gilbertson’s
the other night had been started by him?”</p>

<p>“No! Was she? He’s doing a good work
down there, at tremendous risks, too! If they
find out what he’s up to it will mean tarring and
feathering, and lynching afterward, and all of it
on the spot. He’s a brave fellow, Rhoda!
Where did he send this woman from?”</p>

<p>Rhoda colored. In the excitement and the unusual
press of duties that followed the steamboat
explosion there had been little time for private
talk with her father and beyond the bare
information that the three refugees had been there
and that she had taken them on she had told him
nothing of the incidents of that night. It had
come about that she shrank from saying anything
about Delavan’s being a slaveholder, especially
to her father. It seemed to her a moral obliquity
which her love instinctively yearned to hide from
others. But there was only a moment’s hesitation
before her earnest eyes met his frankly.</p>

<p>“She came from Jeff’s plantation, and she is
the wife of the man, Andrew, to whom Jeff gave
his freedom last summer—you remember? Mr.
Wilson saw him in Canada and he sent word and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
some money to his wife for her to follow him.
She said Mr. Wilson got eleven slaves together,
from different plantations, and started them all
off on the same night. The rest went by other
routes,—mostly, I think, through Philadelphia.
She wanted to come the same way her husband
had taken. Wasn’t it brave of her, father, to
start off alone with those two little children, without
knowing a thing about how or where to go,
except just as she is told, from one station to the
next! She seemed so passive and so trustful! I
haven’t felt so sorry for any of the others that
we’ve helped as I did for her!”</p>

<p>In Dr. Ware’s heart some uneasiness had begun
to make itself manifest lest the presence of
the young man in that room upstairs might yet
influence his daughter more than he wished. Perhaps
he craved reassurance that she did not regret
her decision. Perhaps also unspoken sympathy
with the struggle between her conscience and her
heart moved him as he asked:</p>

<p>“You do not regret, do you, Rhoda, that you
went into this work?”</p>

<p>She looked at him in some surprise and met his
gray, calm eyes bent upon her with something
more like wistfulness in their expression than she
had ever seen in them before.</p>

<p>“No, father, I do not. I am very glad.”
There was no mistaking the truth of her quiet
tones. But the next instant her lip began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
tremble. By sheer force of will she held it firm,
closely pressed against the other, and fought down
the lump that was rising in her throat. That look
in her father’s eyes had made her long to throw
herself upon his breast, and sobbing her heart
out there tell him how hard the struggle had become.
Surely he would sympathize and give her
comfort and strength. For an instant the vision
came back of him and her mother, in their passionate
youth, galloping, galloping, on that wild
ride to their heart’s rest—oh, surely he would
understand both sides of her trouble! But the
habit of years was strong upon them both, and they
sat in silence for a moment longer, while Rhoda
battled down her emotion and her father looked
through a bunch of letters he had taken from his
breast pocket. It was she who spoke first.</p>

<p>“You said you had a letter from Mr. Wilson,
father. Was it about that you wanted to see
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Here it is. He writes from Vicksburg:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Ware</span>: On this same date
I am forwarding to you six copies of “The Burning
Question,” three bound in black and three in
tan. If there have been any changes as to handlers
and forwarders since I was in your neighborhood
can you send some one to the south side of
the river to watch out for them and see that they
do not fall into too appreciative hands? They
are billed to go in the usual way and ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
on hand within a week after this letter reaches
you.’”</p>

<p>He put the letter away and looked at her
anxiously. “Can we take care of them, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we must, father! We must manage to
do it in some way!” She bent forward, looking
at him intently, and into her face crept the expression
he was beginning to see there whenever they
talked or planned or worked together upon this
matter, a strained, eager look, with something in
it of exaltation.</p>

<p>“Walter Kimball and his brother Lewis would
probably be able to go across and keep watch for
them,” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she broke in, “and one of them could
hurry back and let Horace know, as soon as they
get there, and then go over again and help the
other row them across, and Horace could rush up
here and tell us, so that we could be ready for
them. It will be difficult to hide so many,” she
ended doubtfully.</p>

<p>“The boys must arrange to get them here in
the night and then we can manage it. I’ll get
word to Chaddle Wallace to be in the neighborhood
with his peddler’s wagon and he can take
four of them in that. Perhaps one of the Kimball
boys can drive two in our carriage.”</p>

<p>“Or I can, if you want me to. I’ll see that
Lizzie has plenty of things cooked ready for their
supper. Oh, it will go off all right, father, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
we won’t need to keep them here more than an
hour!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make some different arrangement
now that winter will soon be here,” he said
thoughtfully. “We’ll have to contrive some sort
of hiding place in the house or the barn, so that
we can keep them over night if necessary.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering, father, if a sort of little
room couldn’t be hidden in the woodshed, with
the wood piled around it close.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that could be done,” he nodded slowly,
“and it would be a pretty safe place. The slave
chasers would hardly think of investigating an
innocent-looking woodpile. That’s a good suggestion,
Rhoda, and I’ll have it done, and the
winter’s wood stacked all around it. Marshal
Hanscomb has got a pretty keen nose and I think
he’s suspicious about me anyway, just because of
my sentiments. But I reckon that would be too
much for Hanscomb!”</p>

<p>He smiled at his daughter with quiet exultation
in his manner and she smiled back at him proudly
and said it surely would.</p>

<p>“Your mother wants to make a trip down to
Cincinnati soon and Charlotte, of course, would
be glad to go with her.” A trace of embarrassment
suddenly appeared in his manner and, as if
to conceal or to distract himself from some disconcerting
thought, he began looking over and
sorting the letters and papers on his desk. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
have this done while she’s gone,” he added
abruptly.</p>

<p>Rhoda rose, feeling dismissal in the sudden
change in her father’s manner and went slowly
toward the door. She felt what was in his mind.
It had brought discomfort into her own thought,
and more than once she had wondered if she might
not speak to him about it. But unwillingness
even to seem to question his attitude in a matter
so peculiarly intimate between him and her
mother had held her back. Now she knew that
it was in his mind as well as in hers and she felt
that it would grow and become an embarrassment
between them. For herself it was already a stumbling
block whose importance seemed graver with
every episode of her work in the Underground.
Why not meet it at once and get the question settled?</p>

<p>She stopped with her hand on the door knob
and looked back. To her surprise his eyes were
following her, those calm, clear, cool eyes that in
her mind were a sort of embodiment of her father.
They seemed to sum up and express his whole
character and temperament. She could never
think of him without seeing his gray eyes looking
at her, kind, but dispassionate and judicial.</p>

<p>“What is it, Rhoda?” he asked.</p>

<p>She came slowly back, looking down, and conscious
that there must be something almost like
shamefacedness in her manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“I was wondering, father—is it necessary—do
you think—must we keep it from mother always?
Charlotte—it’s just as well—and that’s no matter—but
mother—” She stopped, confused, and
fingered the chair-back beside which she stood.
Her eyes were upon it or she might have seen a
slight flush color his usually pale skin. There
was a moment’s silence before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Don’t misunderstand me about that, daughter,”
he said gently. He did not often address
her except by her name and when he did sometimes
call her “daughter” or “child” it stirred in
her a shy warmth toward him and awoke a half-realized
impulse to cling to his hand or stroke his
hair. The impulse always died away in self-consciousness,
but the warmth remained in her
heart and made her glad.</p>

<p>“If I don’t take your mother into my confidence
about this it is because I want to spare her any
worry or embarrassment or divided feeling that
it might cause her. Don’t think for a minute,”
and his tones were earnest, “that I don’t think she
would be loyal. I know well enough how true
to my interests she would be. But, do you
understand, it might grieve her, or give her some
uneasiness, or even pain, if she knew what we are
doing. Her sympathies are all on the other side.
But I must do this work. It isn’t much, but it
will help, and it seems to me the best that is possible
for me. But I want to do it, if I can, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
adding—without giving her any discomfort.
I’m glad you spoke about it, Rhoda, for I wanted
you to understand.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, father. I understand how you
feel, but—” she had reached the door again, “but,
I wish it didn’t have to be so. I wish we could
tell her.”</p>

<p>“So do I, daughter.” She looked back, surprised
at the unusual sadness in his voice, and saw
him sitting at his desk, his head on one hand and
his eyes on the floor. The sight of him thus
smote her heart. She hesitated an instant, then
went out softly and left him alone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p>Mid-October came, and the day of local elections
in three of the northern states. The whole
country was waiting on the tiptoe of expectancy
for the result. Pennsylvania was the keystone
of the situation. The party that would win the
presidential contest would have to have her
twenty-seven electoral votes, and this state poll
was looked upon as a sure indication of how the
commonwealth would go three weeks later. It
was everywhere admitted that the issue would be
close. Sectional and party feeling and consequent
excitement ran so high and hot that there were
dark forebodings of what might happen. All
men knew that they walked upon a thin crust over
volcanic fires that might burst through at any
moment, upon any pretext.</p>

<p>The Republican party was surprising itself and
the entire country by its showing of remarkable
strength and its brilliant prospects of success.
From the South were coming threats of disunion
louder and more frequent and more positive. In
many of the slave states there was already the stir
of endeavor to agree upon concerted action in
case Frémont should be elected. Through the
north the Democratic and the Whig parties made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
much of these portents as showing the danger
Republican success would mean to the united
country. But the Republican leaders, jubilant
over the proofs of their strength which the campaign
had developed, and secretly recognizing
the weight of this argument, made light of both
it and the southern threats.</p>

<p>And so the whole country waited in breathless
anxiety on that cold and drizzling October day,
with its attention centered on tumultuous Philadelphia,
both sides fearing defeat, both sides
hoping for victory, and all dreading the spark with
which some chance word or untoward accident
might kindle the smoldering passions in that city
into flames that would quickly involve the whole
nation.</p>

<p>Rhoda moved restlessly about the house, showing
little interest in her usual duties and disregarding
her mother’s hints that she was neglecting
their invalid guest. Delavan had almost recovered
from his injuries and in a few days would
return home. Mrs. Ware was sorely disappointed
that his presence in the house had not
affected her daughter’s determination. She began
to feel sure that it must be her husband’s influence
over Rhoda that balked all her own efforts
and nullified the effect of the constant association
from which she had hoped so much.</p>

<p>Jeff asked her advice that morning and they
talked the matter over intimately. She promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
him once more the full measure of her influence
with Rhoda. “I’m afraid it isn’t much,” she
said, a little tremulously. “But I’ll do my best,
Jeff.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mrs. Ware, madam, and I assure
you I shall not go away without trying again
to win her consent.”</p>

<p>“You and little Emmy used to call me ‘Aunt
Emily,’ when I was at Fairmount,” she said with
a suggestion of reproof, half motherly, half coquettish,
if the chastened ghost of a manner that
sometimes remembered its alluring youth might
still be called coquettish.</p>

<p>“It is the dearest wish of my heart to call you
‘mother,’ some day,” he answered, kissing her
hand.</p>

<p>“And of mine to hear you call me so,” she
added, bending over and touching her lips to his
forehead. Then they fell to talking of his
mother and she was deeply interested in the many
little things Jeff remembered of her life at Fairmount.
He recalled that she had always shown
concern for the welfare of the slaves and had
given training in their duties and deportment to
the housemaids and had allowed them and also
the men who served about the house and gardens
to acquire a little education if they wanted it.</p>

<p>“You must tell Rhoda about that,” Mrs. Ware
exclaimed. “Let her see that there is some virtue in
slaveholders. It’s just her notion about slavery being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
wrong that keeps you apart, Jeff. If you could
only convince her that there is as much right in
it as there is in anything in this world, where nothing
is all right, I believe she’d give up. I’ve tried
to, but she seems to think I don’t know enough
about it, in general, for what I say to have any
influence. Talk to her about it, Jeff, and make
her see plainly how we of the South feel about it.
You know how necessary slave labor is to the
South, and all that side of it. She has heard only
the things the abolitionists say, here in the North,
and she’s all taken up with that. But you can give
her the other side, as a southern man with one of
the best and kindest of hearts, who has studied the
question thoroughly. If you can only convince
her that slavery is right, dear boy, or even best for
the niggers, as we know it is, you’ll win the day—and
make me almost as happy as you will Rhoda,
or yourself!”</p>

<p>“It is good advice, madam, and I shall follow
it. I have begun to understand that I must win
Rhoda’s head before she will give up her heart.
But I shall win them both, and call you ‘mother’
yet!”</p>

<p>“Heaven grant it, dear boy, for you were made
for each other, you and my dear girl!”</p>

<p>She rose to take her leave, but Charlotte came
with fresh medicines for the invalid and bustled
about the room preparing his draughts. Mrs.
Ware, with an eye upon her daughter’s graceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
movements, sat down again and talked of ordinary
affairs until she thought Charlotte had spent
as much time there as was needful. Then she
summoned that young lady to go with her and
assist at certain rites in the kitchen.</p>

<p>But Rhoda would not visit the sick-chamber
through all the forenoon. Why she was staying
away she scarcely knew, except that she said to
herself several times during the long hours of the
morning, “He won’t miss me if Charlotte’s there.”
Jeff had obeyed her injunction that he must not
speak of love, and during the last two days had
kept careful curb upon his tongue and close watch
upon the language of his eyes. And she missed
more than she would admit to herself the outbreaks
of those heretofore unruly members. She
shared her father’s suspense over the election that
was going on and during the forenoon, whenever
he was alone in his office, she went in to ask him
if he had heard any news and to talk over the
situation.</p>

<p>More than ever, this fall, he was making a
companion of her and discussing with her as freely
as he did with Horace Hardaker and his other
anti-slavery friends, the plans and movements of
the anti-slavery people, and the prospects of the
Republican party. She was a good listener, rarely
making comments unless she had something worth
while to say, and usually he found what she did
say clear-thoughted and sensible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>On this morning it was not only her interest in
what was going on in Pennsylvania that sent her
every now and again to seek her father’s society.
Of equal force was her desire to escape from the
tormenting questions that filled her mind as to
what Jeff was doing, whether Charlotte was with
him, and whether or not he was wishing she were
there. And so, between her political zeal and
her love, she passed a restless, fruitless morning.</p>

<p>Her mother noted her frequent visits to her
father’s office and, coupling with these the fact
that she had all the morning ignored Delavan’s
presence in the house, made instant inference.
“It’s Amos’s influence over her,” she told herself,
resentment rising bitter in her heart. “He’s urging
her against it and spoiling my dear girl’s life,
just for the sake of his own whims! It’s most
selfish of him—and wicked. But I’ll see what I
can do!”</p>

<p>Knocking at Rhoda’s bedroom door after dinner
she found her daughter sitting at the eastern window,
hands idly folded in her lap, and eyes upon
the wooded hills, whose autumn colors glowed
softly through the gray, dripping mist. It was
so unusual to see her doing absolutely nothing that
Mrs. Ware stared at her in blank surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, Rhoda, you look lonely sitting here all
by yourself,” she said briskly. “Why don’t you
go in and stay with Jeff for a while?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“I don’t know—I guess I don’t feel like it,”
Rhoda responded, a forlorn note in her voice.</p>

<p>“Jeff has been asking for you, dear. In fact,
he’s fretting himself into a fever because you
haven’t even looked into the room all this morning.
And you were there only a little while yesterday—”</p>

<p>“Twice, yesterday, mother.”</p>

<p>“But such a little while each time. It isn’t
kind to leave the poor boy alone all day, on such
a dreary day as this.”</p>

<p>“But Charlotte—”</p>

<p>“No, I want Charlotte to help me to-day. It’s
time she was learning to do more things about
the house. Put on your pink frock, honey, you
look so pretty in that, and go in and cheer Jeff
up for a while.”</p>

<p>Rhoda did not answer, but looked out at the
wet earth and the drizzling rain. Through her
soul there surged such a forceful longing to follow
her mother’s advice that for a moment it
seemed to arrest her powers of both action and
speech.</p>

<p>“Don’t sit here and mope any longer,” her
mother went on with tender cheerfulness, “and
don’t be so unkind to poor, sick Jeff. Come on,
honey, I’ll help you dress.” And opening the
wardrobe she took out the pink gown. Its wide
skirt was covered with tiny flounces and when it
was adjusted over a ruffled petticoat and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
largest hoopskirt, her slender waist and her head
and shoulders rose out of its spreading folds as if
they were emerging from a huge, many-petaled
rose.</p>

<p>Jeff Delavan’s face brightened as she floated
into the room. He was dressed, for the first time
since his accident, and sitting by the window.</p>

<p>“Rhoda! How good of you to come—and to
wear that dress! You’re like a ray of sunshine
on this dark day! I’ve listened and hoped for
you all day, and at last you’re here! You’re such
a busy person, Rhoda, that I ought to feel fortunate
to get even a little of your time. What have
you been doing all the morning? All manner of
things?”</p>

<p>“Yes,—no—that is—yes, I’ve been busy,—I
always am, you know,” she stammered, confused,
remembering how idle her morning had been.
“I’ve been with father part of the time,” she went
on, recovering her self-possession, “talking about
the elections to-day.”</p>

<p>“What do you care about the elections?” he
demanded, in bantering gaiety.</p>

<p>She turned to him with proud gravity. “More
than I do about anything else in the world.”</p>

<p>Quickly his expression changed to one as serious
as her own, and he began to speak of the situation
in Pennsylvania and of his own belief in the
success of the Democratic state ticket. She listened
for a few sentences and then her heart began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
to clamor for signs of love in his face and voice
and words. She ignored the fact that she had forbidden
all such manifestation and knew only that
she wanted it and it was not there. All unknown
to her, in his gladness at her coming her lover
was having his own battle with himself to do her
bidding, and was so fearful lest he should overstep
the line she had drawn and lose her dear
presence that he was plunging into this political
discourse as the safest thing he could do.</p>

<p>She seemed to be paying close attention, but she
heard only a word or a part of a sentence here and
there. Instead, vague fears, half-realized doubts,
uncertain questions filled her brain. Would she
ever again see that look in his face? Did he
ever look at Charlotte like that? Was his love
for her all gone so soon? And then the spirit
of the eternal feminine began to assert itself in
her breast. She was, after all, her mother’s daughter,
and although the spirit of coquetry lay deep
within her breast, so deep that only the call of
truest love could bring it to the surface, yet it
was there and it came now to do her heart’s
bidding.</p>

<p>It was all done instinctively, without conscious
intention. But if her mother or sister could have
looked through the wall they would have been
surprised by the sight of a different Rhoda from
the one they knew. This tender creature of coquettish
graces and alluring smiles and eyelids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
quickly lowered over ardent glances—was she
the practical, efficient daughter of the house,
upon whom they were both so dependent?</p>

<p>Delavan gazed at her, began to stumble over
his sentences, confused the names of the people
of whom he spoke, broke off for an instant, went
back and started anew, then stopped abruptly in
the middle of a sentence. “Rhoda Ware,” he
exclaimed in a low voice that shook with feeling.</p>

<p>At the sound of it Rhoda’s little, half-conscious
coquetries dropped from her instantly. It was a
serious face that his gaze encountered as he surveyed
her with dark eyes glowing and about his
mouth the baffled but determined look that had
become for her a sign of his strength—measure
alike of his self-control and of his determination.
She had seen it in every one of their struggles and
it had seemed always to be saying to her, “You’ve
conquered this time, but I shall win you yet!”
She watched for it and loved it because it told
her alike of her power over him and of his forceful
masculine will, and perhaps also because deep down
in her heart she half believed and almost hoped
it would yet be stronger than her own resolution.</p>

<p>“Why do you insist upon keeping us apart?”
he demanded, an imperious note in his voice.
“You are doing a wicked thing. You’ve no right
to starve both our hearts of the love that belongs
to us, because of a mere whim!”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Jeff, while I tell you the truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and then you won’t want to marry me!” She was
sitting straight and stiff, her face pale, and in it
something of the same exaltation he had seen there
on that June day in the arbor—the outward glow
of the sacrificial fires she had lighted for the consuming
of her love.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I am, Jeff! I am a
nigger-thief and I am proud of it! I am stealing
your slaves, anybody’s slaves that want their freedom,
and helping them to find their way to Canada,
where they will be safe! Jefferson Delavan, of
Fairmount, Kentucky, doesn’t want to marry a
woman who does that sort of thing and means to
keep it up as long as there are slaves and she has
power to help them!”</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment in silent amazement.
“Rhoda, you don’t realize the full significance of
what you are saying, and doing!”</p>

<p>“If I could I would run off every slave from
your plantations and send them all to Canada,
where you could never touch one of them again.
That is how much I realize it!”</p>

<p>A slow smile crept over his face while he regarded
her with a look that was half surprise,
half overleaping love, and was not without a touch
of tender amusement. “But if you were to take
away all my slaves, dear heart, you wouldn’t do
me nearly the harm that you are doing now by
stealing yourself from me!”</p>

<p>Her serious eyes looked straight into his for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
moment in silence, and then her flashing smile
broke over her face. “I won’t ask you to put
your words to the proof,” she said in a quizzical
tone.</p>

<p>He flushed a little. “I know what you mean,”
he answered tenderly, “and if there were no more
in this matter than the mere question of having or
not having slaves I would willingly free all that
I own—ask Emily to divide the property and give
their freedom to all the niggers that might fall
to my share—for your sake, Rhoda, dear, for the
sake of making you my wife. But the South needs
slave labor—has got to have it in order to be
prosperous—and I would be as untrue to my duty
to my state and to my section if I were to do that
as you think you would be to your conscience if
you were to accept slavery.”</p>

<p>She followed quickly upon his last word: “There
can be no need of property or prosperity, as you
call it, equal to the need, the right, of every human
being to his freedom. When you make your comfort
and wealth,—I mean all of you in the South,—of
more importance than that first human right
you are outraging one of God’s laws, and God’s
curse will yet fall heavily upon you because of it.”</p>

<p>“You speak in that way, Rhoda, because—pardon
me—you really know nothing about economic
conditions in the South. You are merely repeating
the words of these abolition fanatics at the North,
where the industrial conditions are such that slave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
labor would not be profitable. If it were, there’d
be a different tune sung north of Mason and
Dixon’s line!”</p>

<p>She shook her head at him. “You say that because
you don’t understand the feeling that is at
the bottom of the anti-slavery movement. It
places human rights above business profits.”</p>

<p>“As to that, we of the South have our human
rights and civil rights, too. We are trying to keep
faith and you of the North are struggling to break
it. You abolitionists forget the big share, the
equal share, the southern states had in the making
of this country, and you forget that they bore
more than their share of the burden and loss of
making it into a nation. There was more blood
shed in South Carolina during the Revolution,
Rhoda, than in Massachusetts, yes, more than in
all New England. And now Massachusetts has the
presumption, the insolence, to try to dictate to us
how we shall order our affairs! We let her alone
to work out her own destiny, and we demand the
same right!”</p>

<p>“But we northerners see farther and see clearer
into the way things are going than you can, because
your eyes are blinded by what you believe
to be your present interests. We want you to
recognize the truth, that this nation was created
to be a free country, that those who made it meant
it to be the hope of the whole world, and it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
never, never, be that as long as you of the South
insist upon making it half slave.”</p>

<p>“You are quite mistaken, Rhoda, as to what
they meant, or, rather, as to the way in which they
meant it. When this nation was created North
and South joined in sworn faith to a written contract.
That contract recognized the rights of the
south in its peculiar, its necessary, institution, and
provided for their safeguarding. And now the
North is trying to break that sworn faith, to force
us out of our constitutional rights. It is not only
our property but our honor that is at stake, and
we should be craven indeed if we did not resent
this combination of despotism and insult! Preston
Brooks was right when he said the other day that
if Frémont is elected the people of the South ought
to march to Washington and seize the archives and
the treasury of the government!”</p>

<p>She was leaning eagerly forward, her eyes shining,
her lips parted, her face, paled by her excitement,
vivid with the feeling that had swept her
up into the regions where soul and body breathe the
elixir of supreme conviction. But when she spoke,
breaking in quickly upon his first pause, it was
not only the fulness of her belief that thrilled in
her low, tense tones. Their lower notes were sweet
with the love that burned in her heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jeff, can’t you see— Oh, I wish I could
make you see that there can be no rights that are
founded on wrong.” She paused a moment, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
voice on a suspended accent, as she gathered her
thoughts together. Delavan’s eyes devoured the
fair picture that she made and his heart leaped in
response to those sweet notes in her voice. His
mind was full of the ideas he had just uttered,
tense with the conviction of their truth, and his
nerves were thrilling with the emotions they had
bred. And this dear girl, leaning toward him with
spirit-lit face, as tense with her convictions as he
with his, was the embodiment of all that northern
feeling and activity which he so much resented,
against which he protested with all his force as a
base invasion of Southern rights.</p>

<p>But, even as his body throbbed with love and
admiration for her fairness and sweetness, his
spirit yearned toward the loftiness of hers. Ah,
they were akin, they were mates, their spirits, even
though they were opposed! He recognized in her
that same fervency of faith, that same power of
devotion to the mind’s ideal, that were bone and
sinew of his own temperament. And they were
on opposing sides of this vital question—so intensely
vital, he felt, to him, to his section, to the
nation, to the whole of civilization! If only
they were joined in their ideals!</p>

<p>“You see, Jeff, when they signed the Constitution,
they hadn’t come to realize yet how wrong slavery
is. Men grow in knowledge of right and wrong,
and we in the North have grown faster on this
question than you have, because we haven’t had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the comfort and the luxury and the wealth produced
by that awful wrong to blind and hinder
us. Our eyes have been opened—God has opened
them for us, and we see slavery for what it is—a
hideous, cruel, horrible thing that keeps human
beings down and makes beasts of them, brutalizes
the souls God made in his image!”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands and began to extend her
arms beseechingly toward her listener. Her pink
sleeves fell back a little and his heart swelled with
longing to see the warm roundness of those arms
reaching out to him in love and surrender. “Oh,
Jeff, it is so wicked, so evil,” she began. “I wish
I could make you see—” her voice broke, she drew
back her arms and dropped her face into her hands,
then sprang to her feet. “And—and—oh, Jeff—”
her voice was thrilling with love, but it trembled
upon sobs and she rushed to the door. “It is
keeping us apart!” she cried, and the door closed
behind her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Charlotte ran upstairs from the veranda and
dashed into her sister’s room. “Do look out,
Rhoda,” she called. “It’s that crazy peddler,
Chad Wallace. He’s asking father if he can keep
his wagon in our barn to-night. Now there’ll be
some fun this evening—he’s so comical, with his
songs and dances!”</p>

<p>Rhoda moved to the window and saw a little,
wiry-looking man talking with Dr. Ware beside
the east gate. A short, sparse growth of graying
whiskers covered his face to the middle of his
cheeks, and pale-colored hair curled around his
neck below his shabby, bell-crowned hat. His
wagon, with side curtains rolled up displaying
boxes piled inside, was at the hitching post.</p>

<p>“He looks just the same as ever, doesn’t he,”
she said calmly, as they stood beside the window
with their arms about each other’s waists. But
her heart was beating faster, for she knew what
his coming meant. She knew that in his dingy
old wagon he was accustomed to make long trips
on the Kentucky side of the river, ostensibly selling
his wares in villages and at farms, but picking up,
whenever opportunity offered, some fugitive slave
and concealing him in a vacant space in the center,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
around which the boxes and packages were carefully
arranged. Then he would cross the river
at the nearest ferry and put the runaway into the
charge of an Underground “station.” Or, sometimes,
he would remain for months at a time in the
neighborhood of one or another of the Underground
routes through Ohio, apparently selling his
stock of notions, but really conveying the fleeing
slaves from one station to another.</p>

<p>Rhoda knew from her father that the people
engaged in the Underground work considered him
one of the safest of the “conductors.” The commonplace
character of his occupation and his
eccentricities, which Dr. Ware told her were mainly
assumed in order that he might appear all the more
innocent, had proved so efficient a disguise as to
prevent, even in pro-slavery communities, the least
suspicion of his real business.</p>

<p>Word had come that afternoon that the expected
half-dozen fugitives had safely reached the Kentucky
shore and would cross the river in a rowboat
after dark. Chad Wallace ate supper with
the Ware household and entertained them with
stories of his travels told with so many touches
of eccentric humor that he kept the table in a
breeze of laughter. Jeff Delavan, who was to leave
for his home the next day, enjoyed them so much
that he invited the peddler if he ever journeyed
as far south as Lexington to drive on to Fairmount,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
where he would be glad to see him and
listen to more of his amusing stories.</p>

<p>On the veranda after supper Charlotte begged
Wallace for some of his funny dances, and he did
negro shuffles and antics and sang negro melodies
down the front walk to the gate. There he kept
up the entertainment, interspersing the negro songs
with doggerel of his own composition, until a delighted
audience of children, young people and a
few of their elders had gathered. Finally, waving
his old hat at them, he walked away, breaking into
a song that was much heard in those days at anti-slavery
meetings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“Then lift that manly right hand, bold plowman of the wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Its branded palm shall prophesy ‘Salvation to the Slave!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Jeff Delavan, listening on the veranda, started
angrily, the amused smile died from his face and
his brows knit in a frown. The tenor voice, still
surprisingly good, though somewhat cracked by
age, rang back from down the street as the slender,
wiry figure disappeared in the dusk:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“Hold up its fire-wrought language that whoso reads may feel</div>
<div class="verse">His heart swell strong within him, his sinews change to steel.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Is he that sort of a crank?” Jeff exclaimed in
a low voice to Mrs. Ware, who sat beside him. “If
he is, I don’t care about his coming to Fairmount.”</p>

<p>“There’s no harm in Chaddle Wallace,” she
responded assuringly. “He isn’t much more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
half-witted, and nobody ever takes seriously anything
he says or does. But he has this quaint vein
of humor, so that people are always glad to see
him and hear him talk. He loves music, too, but
I don’t suppose he cares at all about the meaning
of the words. As for that abolition thing, why,
he’s just as likely to break into ‘Dixie’ and sing it
with just as much gusto. Oh, no, Jeff, Chad Wallace
is a harmless creature!”</p>

<p>It was some hours later and the house was
dark, save for a light in Dr. Ware’s office, when
Rhoda, watching at her bedroom window, discerned
some shapes in the darkness hurrying up
the hill. As they emerged into the dim circle of
light from the lantern at their east gate, she saw
that it was Chad Wallace and his little band of
runaway slaves. Softly she ran downstairs to admit
them into the office. Her father was there,
but asleep on the lounge. With the utmost caution,
walking on tiptoe and speaking only in whispers,
she and Lizzie brought into the office their supper
of bread and meat and hot coffee and in half an
hour they were ready to start again upon their way.
As they stole silently out of the house Dr. Ware
bundled three of them into his carriage, which Jim
had ready at the gate, and the other three were
quickly concealed in the peddler’s wagon. With
even less of noise than was usually occasioned by
the physician’s response to a night call, the party
set forth on its journey to the next station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Hurriedly extinguishing the lights and locking
the doors, Rhoda stole back to her room and leaning
from her window listened to the distant sound
of wheels for assurance that, so far, all was well.
Her heart beat high, as it always did after they
had passed successfully through one of these night
episodes. For she knew the never-ceasing danger
that the fugitive might have been followed and
trailed to their house. All along the southern
border of the state there were numbers of men,
from both sides of the river, who spent most of
their time hunting runaway slaves, for the sake of
the rewards for their capture. She and her father
were well aware that their succoring of fugitives
might be interrupted at any moment by the entrance
of the United States marshal and his band
of armed men, with consequent arrest, trial, and
imprisonment.</p>

<p>The words that the peddler had sung were running
insistently through her brain and as she lighted
her candle she softly hummed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“Hold up its fire-wrought language that whoso reads may feel</div>
<div class="verse">His heart swell strong within him, his sinews change to steel.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Yes, that’s just it,” she nodded to her reflection
in the mirror, as she placed her hand against her
heart. “That’s just how it makes me feel whenever
I think of any of the horrible things that
slavery means.”</p>

<p>She knew the history of the incident that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
given to the Quaker poet inspiration for the lines—the
branding by a southern court with the letters
“S. S.”—“slave stealer”—of the captain of a
little coastwise vessel for attempting to carry some
slaves from Florida to the Bahamas and freedom
under English law. Holding up her own long,
slender hand with knitted brows and lips compressed
she gazed at the palm, as if trying to
imagine how it would seem to feel the red-hot
iron searing her own flesh. Then with a disdainful
gesture she threw out her arm, her head high and
eyes shining. “They may brand me on my palms
and my cheeks and my forehead too if they like—what
would that be beside this work!”</p>

<p>Counting on her fingers she murmured, “This
makes twenty-five we’ve sent on to liberty—and in
such a little time! Oh, we’re helping the slaves,
and oh, please God”—she dropped on her knees
beside her bed with her face in her hands, “please
God, we’re doing something to help kill slavery!”</p>

<p>At the breakfast-table the next morning Delavan
asked concerning the entertaining peddler and
was told that he must have made an early start, as
Jim on his first errand to the stables had reported
his wagon already gone.</p>

<p>“Does he travel at night?” the young man
asked. “Sometime in the night, when I wakened
after my first sleep, I thought I heard his wagon
leaving the barn.”</p>

<p>Rhoda hastened to say that perhaps it was her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
father’s carriage he had heard, as he had had to
make a night trip. Charlotte, chancing to look at
her sister as Delavan asked his question, thought
that Rhoda started and changed color ever so little.
Immediately her alert mind began to wonder why,
and she fixed her eyes sharply upon her sister’s
face. Rhoda felt her gaze and endeavored to
change the subject quickly in order to ward off the
insistent questions which it would be like Charlotte
to begin to ask. But at that moment Bully Brooks
came unexpectedly to her assistance. Passing
under her chair he emerged from beneath her skirt
and playfully leaped at a bit of string on the
floor. Charlotte saw him and, remembering certain
kittenish tricks which he had not yet grown
too old to play beneath her own hoopskirts, she
smiled knowingly at her sister and dropped the
subject from her thought.</p>

<p>Later in the day Jefferson Delavan took his departure,
and under his escort Mrs. Ware and Charlotte
went down the river to Cincinnati. Since
their argument on election day Rhoda had given
him no opportunity to renew his love siege. Nevertheless,
her heart was like lead in her breast,
now that he was really going, and she was afraid
to trust herself alone with him lest she would find
herself saying, “Stay, oh, stay a little longer!”
And yet she felt relief at the thought that the dear
torment would now be lessened, glad that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
might rest from the keener strife within herself
that his presence provoked.</p>

<p>When he bade her good-by he held her hand
closely and said, “We’ve not spoken the last word
yet, Rhoda Ware! I’m coming again some day,—though
I hope I won’t be exploded into your
house the next time!”</p>

<p>Her eyes were serious upon his face, but she
felt her cheeks growing warmer with the pressure
of his hand. She told herself that she ought to
withdraw her own, but afterwards she knew that
she had not even tried to take it out of his clasp.
“You’d better not come,” she said gravely. “What
is the use?”</p>

<p>“But at least I may come—to see your mother!”
he exclaimed, smiling, and an answering ripple of
mirth drove the gravity from her countenance.</p>

<p>It was nearly a week after the state elections
before it was known certainly that the Democratic
ticket in Pennsylvania had won, by a narrow
margin, over the candidates upon whom the three
other parties had united. Rhoda listened as her
father, Hardaker, and the two Kimballs discussed
the result. They were gathered around a cheerful
blaze in the sitting-room fireplace, for the evenings
had grown chill. Her mother and Charlotte had
not yet returned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve lost,” said Dr. Ware calmly, “and
among ourselves we may as well admit it, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of course we’ll keep up a hopeful appearance in
public.”</p>

<p>But Hardaker was more buoyant. “There’s
hope yet,” he insisted. “Pennsylvania has always
reversed her state victory at a following presidential
election. And there’s no reason to suppose
that she’ll do otherwise this time. I still
believe we’re going to win.”</p>

<p>Rhoda saw her father suddenly compress his lips
and throw a quick glance around their little circle.
“To tell the truth,” he said slowly in a low tone,
“just here among ourselves, though I wouldn’t admit
it outside, I hope we are defeated this time.”</p>

<p>The rest started with surprise and Walter Kimball
exclaimed, “For God’s sake, Dr. Ware! What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Frémont is not the man we need. He hasn’t
the capacity, he hasn’t the strength of character to
meet the crisis the country would have to face if he
should be elected. He’s served a good purpose
in this campaign—he’s created enthusiasm and
stimulated the growth of Republican sentiment.
But that’s all he’s good for.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve made a marvelous showing, anyway,”
said Hardaker in a triumphant tone, “and
we’ve got the South scared and their northern allies
shaking in their boots over the safety of their pet
institution. In another four years,” he straightened
up, his eyes glowing, and went on in a voice
of jubilant prophecy, “we’ll sweep the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and show the South that there’s got to be an end
of slavery!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll do it next time, if we haven’t this!”
exclaimed Lewis Kimball with enthusiasm. “But,
as Dr. Ware says, we’ll have to have the best man
possible to lead the procession. Who’ll it be?
Frémont again? Seward? Governor Chase?
What do you think, doctor?”</p>

<p>Rhoda watched her father anxiously as he gazed
into the fire. “No, not Frémont—heaven forbid!”
he began slowly. “He has revealed his weakness.
Governor Chase is with us, heart and soul, but I’m
afraid he isn’t quite big enough. Seward?—Perhaps,
if he hasn’t proved too conservative by that
time. Well, we’ll have to work with all our might
during the next four years and trust to God to
raise up some man as a leader who’ll have the wisdom
of Solomon and the backbone of a granite
mountain!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p>Almost as much heartened by the result of the
presidential election as if it had been a victory,
Dr. Ware and his friends and political co-workers
in Hillside lost no time in renewing and extending
the work of the campaign.</p>

<p>“If we have polled such a tremendous vote as
this,” they said, “when the party in many northern
states was no more than a year old, what can we
not do in the next four years?”</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountain Club, through which they
had carried on the Frémont propaganda, was reorganized
and every member went zealously to
work again to win converts to their faith and add
to their membership. Joshua Giddings, ardent
apostle of the anti-slavery cause, journeyed down
from his home in the Western Reserve during a
recess of Congress and made for them a stirring
speech. To another meeting came Governor Chase
with words of hope and encouragement and practical
advice. And on one memorable night Henry
Ward Beecher roused an overflowing hall to a
pitch of enthusiastic resolution hardly equaled even
during the campaign.</p>

<p>Rhoda attended the meetings with her father
and shared his zeal in the work the club was doing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
She and Mrs. Hardaker, Horace’s mother, and
Marcia Kimball organized an “Anti-Slavery Sewing
Circle” which met at the houses of the members
and made clothing for such of the refugees
as reached the Hillside station ragged and shivering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware knew only in a general way of her
daughter’s interest and work in connection with
this society, and of Rhoda’s connection with the
Underground she knew nothing at all. Deeply
grieved, but not yet despairing, over the girl’s refusal
to marry the son of her old friend, she set
herself to combat, in gentle, unobtrusive ways,
what she believed to be the harmful influence
exerted by her husband over their first-born.</p>

<p>She talked much with Rhoda about the delightfulness
of plantation life and she dwelt long and
lovingly upon Jeff Delavan’s passionate devotion
and upon his ambition and capacities which, she
was sure, would result in a career of national
renown. Rhoda hearkened with interest, saying
but little in opposition, for her heart had begun to
ache for her mother almost as much as it did for
herself and she shrank from bringing the hurt look
into those gentle eyes any oftener than she found
necessary. But sometimes, when evasion was no
longer possible, she would say, with caresses, and
humble manner:</p>

<p>“Dear mother, you don’t know how much all
you tell me makes me long for that kind of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and surroundings. I think the wish for them must
have been born in me. But, mother, dear mother,
I couldn’t endure them if they meant being a part
of slavery. Perhaps I should feel different about
it if I had been born there, as you were, and had
grown up in it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware knew of the efforts his wife was
making to win Rhoda’s consent and, perceiving
that her arguments and presentations made a strong
appeal to their daughter’s temperament, set himself
to counteract any effect they might have by appeals
to her conscience. But he openly urged no argument
against the marriage, and in all his talk with
her he took it for granted that the question was
settled for good.</p>

<p>Once he told her the story of Fanny Kemble,
then at the zenith of her fame,—of how, for
love’s sake, she had married a slaveholder, although
herself convinced of the wrongfulness of
slavery, and of how life on the plantation, in close
contact with the system, had filled her with such
loathing that she had not long been able to endure
it.</p>

<p>“I am very glad, Rhoda,” he added, “that you
were able to appreciate, before it was too late, just
what it would mean to marry into the South’s ‘peculiar
institution.’ You have saved yourself a great
deal of unhappiness.”</p>

<p>But especially did Dr. Ware have confidence in
anti-slavery work as a preventive of possible weakening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
in his daughter’s determination. To that
end he encouraged her in her sewing-circle activities,
enlisted her help in the sending out of
pamphlets, newspapers and other literature which
was a part of the work of the Rocky Mountain
Club, and entrusted largely to her care the refugee
slaves who sought the shelter of their house.</p>

<p>Husband and wife said not a word to each other
of their opposing desires. Silence upon the question
of Rhoda and Delavan was a part of their
lifelong habit of ignoring the question of slavery
in their mutual relations. But each felt so much
at stake in their silent struggle that gradually it
forced them apart, and as the winter months wore
on there grew up between them the first alienation
of their married life.</p>

<p>Rhoda was soon sensible of the growing coldness
between her father and mother and guessed its
cause. Her heart ached over the unhappiness she
had so unintentionally brought about and she spent
much thought and many secret tears upon the endeavor
to find some way out of the intolerable
situation. Sometimes, in her misery over having
brought such disaster into her home, she felt that,
if it would only heal the breach, she could even
sacrifice her scruples against becoming a part of
the system of slavery.</p>

<p>“But it wouldn’t do any good,” was the conclusion
to which she had always to come. “For if
I were to marry Jeff it would make father bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
unhappy and he would blame mother for having
influenced me to give way. And as long as I don’t
marry him mother will keep on feeling that it is
father’s fault and being angry with him because
of it.”</p>

<p>The hiding place for runaway slaves was completed
during the stay of Mrs. Ware and Charlotte
in Cincinnati, in October. It was a little,
narrow room, or cell, long enough for a man to
stretch himself at length on the floor and high
enough for him to sit upright on a bench. On
three sides and across the top, cords of wood for
the winter fires were stacked in orderly array. But
on the third side, containing the entrance, where
there was only a little space between the room and
the back wall of the shed, the wood was piled
irregularly. From any but a very searching eye
these apparently haphazard sticks would conceal
the tiny, boarded structure, while in a moment they
could be thrown aside and passage in or out made
easy. Within, a pile of straw and some old quilts
and carriage rugs made a bed comfortable enough,
save on the worst of winter nights, for those who
had seldom known a better.</p>

<p>If a wayfarer gave the four signal knocks on a
night too bitterly cold for him to be housed in
the woodpile shelter Rhoda, into whose charge her
father had given most of the work of conducting
their “station,” risked discovery by making some
arrangement for him within the house. Once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
when the traveler was a man alone, she bedded
him for the rest of the night on the lounge in the
office, until early morning, when Jim hurried him
to the woodshed. Another time, when the suppliants
were a husband and wife and little child,
a bed was improvised for them in Jim and Lizzie’s
room.</p>

<p>But, zealously absorbed though she was in this
work and convinced that it was righteous and
would have a good result, Rhoda was never free
from twinges of conscience because it was being
carried on without her mother’s knowledge. “It
is her home and it isn’t fair for her not to know
about it,” she thought, time after time, as the
winter went by. “Of course, she wouldn’t like it
and it would make her most unhappy to know
about it, and it is very dear in father to want to
save her the pain of knowing. I know it’s right
for us to do it—we must— Oh, dear! It’s just
another of these dreadful knots of right and
wrong all mixed up that the North and South have
tangled themselves into! And slavery is at the
bottom of it all,—and slavery is the thing we must
get rid of—tear it all out—no matter—no matter
who is hurt!”</p>

<p>The winter months, with their likelihood of
cold and storms, greatly lessened the Underground
traffic. But even so, rarely a week went by without
the coming of at least one dark-faced runaway
from the South, trusting to find, at “the white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
house on the top of the hill with a lantern at the
gate,” shelter, food, and help for the next stage
of his journey.</p>

<p>For Rhoda it was a busy winter and its weeks
sped by rapidly until the warming sun brought
promise that the spring was already on her way.
Then there came a night of cold and blustering
wind with dashes of rain. It was near daylight
when Rhoda was roused from sound sleep by Lizzie,
who was bending over her bed and softly
calling her name. A fugitive was downstairs, tired
out and wet to the skin.</p>

<p>The runaway was a young mulatto, scarcely
more than a lad, who had absconded from his
owner, a horse dealer in a Kentucky town, because
he had learned that he was about to be sold to a
trader who was collecting a party of negroes for
the owner of a Louisiana cotton plantation. He
was already planning to earn enough money in
Canada to buy “free papers” for his mother, who
was owned by a merchant in the same town. But
he was oppressed by the fear that she might be
sold “down south” before he would be able to
rescue her. From her box of clothing, kept on
hand for such emergencies, Rhoda gave him new,
dry garments, he was fed and warmed, and then
taken to the woodshed shelter where, since he was
so wearied, he was left to rest and sleep through
all the next day.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her many activities and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
zeal for the anti-slavery cause, Jeff Delavan was
never absent long from Rhoda’s mind, nor did she
even try to banish him from her thoughts. Every
now and then came a long letter from him which
she read and re-read and pondered over, and finally
answered at equal length. These letters she
frankly read, with now and then a reservation, to
her mother, who, as the months went by, began to
hope that finally she and Jeff together would overcome
the girl’s resolution. Rhoda entered into
the social gaieties of the town much less that
winter than had formerly been her custom. Her
days were so fully occupied and the nights were
so likely to bring responsibility that she was reluctant
to leave her post. Moreover, since she
had become so much absorbed in anti-slavery work,
social pleasures had for her less attraction. Charlotte
gibed at her frequently on this account.</p>

<p>“You’re no better than an old maid already,
Rhoda,” she complained that same morning when
the mulatto boy was sleeping in the woodshed.
They were working together, dusting and tidying
the big, bright living-room. Charlotte had been
to a party the night before with Billy Saunders
and his sister Susie, who was her particular friend.
But it had taken much coaxing of her mother, with
a final appeal to her father’s indulgence, to win a
reluctant consent for her to go without the watchful
care of her elder sister.</p>

<p>“Really, I think it’s unkind of you to stay at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
home so much when you know mother doesn’t like
me to go without you.”</p>

<p>“But she let you go last night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, because father asked her to. But she
didn’t want to do it.” Charlotte paused in her
work and regarded her sister with brown eyes
sparkling. “Say, Rhoda,” she giggled, “do you
suppose father would have sided with me if he’d
known about—Horace, last fall?”</p>

<p>Rhoda laughed, then drew her face into admonishing
seriousness. “Aren’t you ever going to
be ashamed of yourself about that, Charlotte?
You ought to be!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I’m not! And I’ll do it again some
day, if you don’t quit being such an old maid and
sticking at home so much!”</p>

<p>“I guess Horace would know better another
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s not the only one!” Charlotte tossed
her head and her saucy countenance twinkled with
mischief. Rhoda noted her expression and wondered
what it might portend, but said nothing. “If
you’re not going to marry Jeff Delavan,” she went
on, “it’s time somebody else did! The idea of
letting such a fine young man, with a beautiful old
estate like Fairmount, pine away in single misery!”</p>

<p>“Jeff is free to marry any one he likes, who’ll
have him.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll have him! The idea! Rhoda, I never
heard of such a simpleton as you are! Well, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
you’re determined to be an old maid, after such a
chance as that, you don’t deserve a bit of sympathy,
no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>Charlotte pursed her lips to the tune of “Comin’
thro’ the Rye” and started toward the door. “Jeff
was exceedingly nice to me on the boat going down
to Cincinnati,” she threw back with a bright glance
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Jeff is a gentleman and is always very courteous
and attentive to ladies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is he?” was Charlotte’s response with a
significant intonation. “Well, I’m awfully tired of
all the young men in Hillside and—Horace isn’t
the only one, Rhoda!” she ended in her most teasing
accents as she danced away, waving her duster.</p>

<p>In spite of all her efforts to drive it away, a dull
ache settled in Rhoda’s breast as she thought over
Charlotte’s words. She felt sure that behind them
lay some intention of more moment than were that
young lady’s ordinary vagaries. As she had so
often done before, she told herself sharply that she
had no right to stand in Charlotte’s way, that if
she did not intend to marry Jefferson Delavan she
ought not to try to hold his love. And her heart
answered back triumphantly that Jeff knew very
well he could not hope to make her his wife and
that if he nevertheless chose to remain faithful to
her she could not be blamed.</p>

<p>As she straightened the piano cover and set
the chairs against the wall Rhoda’s lips curved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
a proud little smile at the thought that his love
for her was strong enough, her attraction for him
potent enough, to hold his heart thus steadily
against her constant refusal of his wish. For herself,
she knew that she would never marry any one
else. But it was different, she told herself, with
a man. Naturally, she reflected, no one could
expect him to remain true very long to a girl who
told him “no” over and over again, and it would
be no more than any man would be likely to do if
he consoled himself with some other girl’s love.
It would be much harder to bear, she confessed
to herself, if that girl should be her own sister
than if she were some far-away being who would
take Jeff entirely out of her life and leave him and
their unfortunate love a mere memory.</p>

<p>The thought of such an ending of their romance,
wherein she would be compelled to see her sister in
the place which by right of love ought to be her
own, made more insistent the ache in her heart and
presently drove her upstairs to lock her door and
take from her bureau the box tied with white ribbon.
A number of letters lay in it now, beneath the
faded rose. She took them out, caressingly, turning
each one over in her hands, noting its date,
glancing with soft eyes at its closely written pages.
Then she began to read them as carefully as if she
had not already pored over them a dozen times.
For the most part they were arguments in defense
of the institution of slavery and the interests of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
his section. But these were interspersed with
items of personal interest, little accounts of what
he and his sister were doing, comments upon the
duties and the pleasures of their life, and now and
then an audacious mention, which would make
Rhoda at first frown and then smile tenderly, of
some holiday they would make or something they
would do when she should be installed as mistress
at Fairmount. But evidently her lover was hoping
to win her by appeals to her intelligence, by trying
to convince her that the ideals which he and his
section cherished were righteous and desirable.</p>

<p>“I do not yet understand,” she read in the latest
letter, still unanswered, “how any one possessing
a nature as noble and upright as I know yours
to be can yet engage in that work in which you told
me you glory so much. (I refer to the assisting of
runaway slaves). I do not see how you can reconcile
the deliberate breaking of the laws of your
country and the taking of other people’s property
with the dictates of a scrupulous conscience. But
I am well assured that you would not engage in this
course if you did not believe it to be thoroughly
honorable and right. And therefore I merely
accept the fact and marvel at it.”</p>

<p>“The negro is on a moral and intellectual plane
so much lower than the white man,” met her eyes
in another letter, “that it is evident he was designed
by an all-wise God to be the white man’s
servitor, just as are the other domestic animals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
The Almighty meant the white man to use him
for his own benefit in order that he might the more
easily mount to higher spheres of cultivation and
achievement. Between the races there is a natural
relation, ordained by God himself when he created
the black so much inferior to the white, and
we are but carrying out His decrees when we embody
that natural, heaven-declared superiority and
inferiority into the legal relation of master and
slave.”</p>

<p>Presently her attention was attracted by farther
development of the same theme in a more recent
missive: “The idea that it is possible for the
negro to profit by civilization, to advance or develop,
is a monstrous delusion, held only by a few
people at the North who know nothing about his
real character. To attempt to force him into
channels of life and into efforts for which he is
by nature unfitted, as they are bent on doing, would
be to turn the natural order of things topsy-turvy
and bring destruction upon the whole nation. For
a free Negrodom in the midst of our republic
would swamp it in savagery.”</p>

<p>Over the concluding page of the last letter she
pored thoughtfully, stopping now and then to consider
again the ideas it contained. For she could
not deny to herself the seductive appeal of the aims
it set forth, whatever she thought of the arguments
upon which they were based. Interested though
she was in these lines, she yet remembered to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
her hand over the bottom of the page. She knew
what was there, but she knew too that if she hid
it from eyes that would be drawn in that direction
it would leap at her, when suddenly disclosed, with
a fresh thrill of happiness.</p>

<p>“In this beautiful Southland,” she read, “we are
working out what will prove to be the crowning
glory of civilization. Here man, free to reach his
highest possible development, enjoying political
liberty, delivered by the divine institution of slavery
from the hampering, benumbing effects of
labor, surrounded by comfort, beauty, affluence,
can produce the finest fruits of human effort. Here
a refined and beautiful social order is being established,
learning encouraged, chivalrous feeling and
living made possible, womanhood reverenced, all
intellectual achievement honored and sought after,
and here letters and art will flourish as they have
not flourished anywhere on the face of the earth
since the Christian era began. Here will it be
possible, and here only in all the world, for a
modern Greece to grow into the fulness of beautiful
flower. Here poets and artists and orators
and statesmen and men of science and women,
whose beauty and grace and talent will make them
social queens as powerful as were the ladies of the
French salons, will be appreciated and honored
and find it possible to reach their finest, fairest
development. Here in the new world, in our own
native land, will be made possible a reincarnation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
of all that ‘glory that was Greece, and grandeur
that was Rome,’ as our own lamented southern
poet has so beautifully sung.”</p>

<p>Thus far she read, and then, lifting her eyes
from the page, looked steadily away for a moment.
A soft and tender light shone in their
gray depths as, smiling gently, she dropped them
again upon the page and removed her concealing
hand.</p>

<p>“Is it not a glorious prospect, and is it not worth
while, my own dear heart, to have some share in
bringing about so grand a consummation? What
better can I do in the world than to help my beloved
South to maintain and extend her social order
in which the negro, a mere animal, does the work
for which he is fitted and to which he was appointed
by the Creator, and the white man, created
by God in His own image, is left unhampered to
develop his own God-given talents and so produce
such splendid results? But I am lonely, my dear
one, and I long always for the presence and the
companionship of the mate God made for me.
Rhoda, darling, do not be cruel any longer! Tell
me I can come and claim her! Always, your friend
and lover, Jefferson Delavan.”</p>

<p>For a little while Rhoda sat gazing at those
closing lines, and then, with a sigh, she prepared
to write her answer. She made several beginnings
that did not suit her and tossed the pages to one
side. “Dear Friend Jeff,” she finally wrote. “Concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
what you say about my doing things that
are contrary to law, I must tell you that when men
make laws that outrage every sense of right and
justice in my own heart then I think that to disobey
them is the only right and honorable course.
The law of God is higher than the law of man.
The law of God commands us to help the needy,
to succor the oppressed, to aid the wayfarer, to
deal justly by all men. That is what I have been
doing and what I shall continue to do, although I
break a whole houseful of man’s unjust and wicked
laws.”</p>

<p>She worked on through his letter, seriously answering
an argument here, gaily deriding a point
there, now displaying a hint of tenderness in some
inquiry concerning his welfare, and again replying
with vivacious but evasive sallies to personal remarks
in which the lover seemed to overbalance
the friend, until at last she came to the closing
page. Then she laid down her pen and read it
over again, realizing fully the enthusiasm, ambition
and youthful energy which stirred and fed
his devotion to this ideal of his section, and feeling
also to the depths of her soul how completely it
parted them. Her lips were trembling and her
eyes dim with tears as she took up her pen again.</p>

<p>“I will not deny,” she wrote, “that the picture
you draw of a South in which men and women
would make the highest and finest kind of civilization,
is very attractive to me. Or, rather, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
would be if your beautiful social order were not
rooted in the hideous slime of slavery. I cannot believe
that it would endure, or that it would be anything
but a curse to the world as long as beneath
it were the groans, the chains, the unpaid toil and
misery of so many thousands of other men and
women unfortunate enough to have been born with
black skins. It will never be possible for you to
claim me as long as you are a part of such a
system. But I hope you will always remember
me as your truest friend, Rhoda Adeline Ware.”</p>

<p>She always signed her name thus in her letters to
him, although she never used her middle name
elsewhere, because it was a token of their mothers’
friendship and so it seemed to her to belong
specially to their intercourse and to give to it a shy
little fragrance of exclusion, of separateness from
everything else.</p>

<p>But when she had finished she pushed it all aside
and dropped her face on her arm and her whole
body trembled with a long, deep sob. Her heart
was answering the call of his, which she had heard
and refused to heed, through every line of his letters.
They were so far apart, their faces were set
toward such hostile ideals! And yet across that
deep gulf their spirits clamored and their bodies
yearned for presence, for companionship, each for
its mate. Through a blur of tears she took up
her pen and groped for a fresh sheet of paper.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jeff, Jeff,” her pen was flying across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
page, “how will it be possible to endure this separation
longer? Surely it is wrong for people who
love as we do to tear themselves apart like this.
I cannot endure it, and yet I cannot consent. Come
then, and carry me away in spite of myself.” Ah,
it was a relief to give way to her feelings, to
write the things she longed to say, even though
she did not intend that he should ever read them.
The pain in her face, the drawn look of mental
suffering, began to fade out of it. “Tie my feet
and my arms, if you must, so that I cannot run
from you. Stop my lips with kisses, so that I
cannot say I will not go. Take me in your arms
and carry me away, anywhere, but do not let me
deny our love any longer.”</p>

<p>It was the cry of the primitive woman, whose
sane instinct for the strong mate lives on through
all the thousand and one denials and perversions of
civilization. From the days when courtship was
seizure, and first choice belonged to the strongest,
has the wish to be won in spite of herself lived on
in the heart of woman. It has been buried deep
and ever deeper beneath the accruing refinements
of humanity, and forced to find dwarfed expression
in the subterfuges with which the civilized
woman evades and refuses her wooer, that finally
she may make pretense of her unwilling capture.
But now, from beneath the depths of a million
years, it rose suddenly to the surface of a strong
woman’s heart and overpowered all her strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Her hand was shaking and her bosom heaving
as she put the sheet to one side. There was a
knock at the door and Charlotte’s voice called
out: “Rhoda! Please let me have some of your
paper. I’ve used mine all up.”</p>

<p>Opening her door a mere crack she handed out
paper and envelopes, for she had no wish to give
her sister’s inquiring mind a chance to speculate
upon the reason for her agitated countenance. But
it was only a moment more, with a little resolute
drawing in of her breath and a pressure of her
lips, and a minute or two before the mirror, until
her composure was restored. Then she heard her
mother in the hall: “Come, Rhoda! Come, Charlotte!
Dinner’s ready!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, in just a minute,” she called back.
Jeff’s letters were quickly laid away in their box.
Then she gathered up the sheets of her own letter
and hurriedly folded them into the envelope, which
she addressed and sealed. For after dinner she
was going to a meeting of the anti-slavery sewing
circle. The discarded sheets she twisted together
and tossed into the fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p>At the dinner table Mrs. Ware’s eyes rested
with loving anxiety upon her first-born. “She is
surely growing thinner and paler,” was her motherly
thought. “Poor child! If she would only
give up to her love how much happier she would
be! It’s just eating out her heart, I know it is!
If Jeff would take hold of her as Amos did of
me—” and she glanced across the table at her
husband, who in the grave responsibility of his
middle age seemed far enough removed from the
impetuous and masterful lover of her girlhood.</p>

<p>Quickly trailing upon the thought came recollection
of that ride of which she had told Rhoda
and Jeff, and then a wave of memories of his
ardent courtship swept over and softened her heart.
The coldness and resentment of the last few
months were buried, for the moment, underneath
their warmth and color, and her eyes sought his
face again with more of fondness in their expression
than he had seen there in many a day. Then
her mind went back to her daughter.</p>

<p>“But I reckon that wouldn’t answer with Rhoda,
after all,” she told herself. “She’s so different.
But I really believe she’s beginning to feel more
like giving up. The way she looked when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
read his last letter to me and when we talked about
him yesterday—yes, she’s surely finding out how
much she really cares. If Jeff were to come up
again now, perhaps—I’ll write to him and tell
him to come!”</p>

<p>The persuasion that perhaps the matter would
come out all right added to the good feeling toward
her husband already induced by her memories, and
when they rose from the table she moved to his side
and looked up into his face with a little glow of
tenderness and affection in her own. With quick
response he rested a hand upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Which way are you going this afternoon,
Amos?” she asked.</p>

<p>“First to the Winslows, after I keep my office
hour. Harriet is sick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor little thing! I’ll go over with you.
I must write a letter now, but if you’ll call me when
you’re ready to go I’ll come down at once and we
can drive past the post-office.”</p>

<p>It was the first time in many weeks that she had
wished to drive with him and he stooped and
kissed her, saying, “I’ll be glad to have you,
Emily.”</p>

<p>With her letter in her pocket Rhoda hurried
away, past the post-office, to the meeting of the
sewing circle, at Mrs. Hardaker’s home. The
members had planned to put in a particularly busy
afternoon, for the coming of spring would be sure
to bring with it an increase in the number of refugees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
and they must have ready plenty of clothing
suitable for warm weather.</p>

<p>Charlotte went back to her room and was soon
absorbed in a composition that seemed to perplex
her much. She wrote a few lines or words upon
sheet after sheet, then frowned and shook her
head and tore up and threw aside one after another
until her table was littered with them. But at
last, after much knitting of her brows and tapping
with her gold pencil, she appeared satisfied with
what she had done and copied it, in a few lines
across the middle of the page, upon a sheet of
the paper borrowed from Rhoda.</p>

<p>As she read it again, her eyes twinkled and her
chin tilted to its most rebellious angle. “I reckon
mother would put her foot down hard if she knew
about it,” she said to herself, and then pursed her
lips and whistled a few notes. “And Rhoda would
think it a very shocking thing for me to do. But I
don’t care, I’m going to. I reckon father wouldn’t
mind—indeed, I’m sure he’d be pleased. Yes,
father would be glad enough if Jeff should— So
it’s all right.” She giggled softly and the look of
amusement deepened on her face as she addressed
the envelope.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed as she sealed the letter,
“now there’ll be some fun!” Springing to her
feet she danced about the room, stopping in front
of the mirror after a few steps to practise tilting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
her hoopskirts, without seeming to do so, at a
higher angle than she had ever dared before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware, starting downstairs, in bonnet and
shawl, with her letter in her pocket, heard a shriek
from Charlotte’s room. “What’s the matter,
dearie?” she called in quick alarm, and opened
the door.</p>

<p>Charlotte was standing on a chair in front of
her closet door, her skirts drawn up to her knees,
her two plump calves and slender ankles and trim
little feet trembling with the agitation which shrilled
in her voice: “Oh, mother, there’s a mouse in
my closet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all, honey! My heart was in my
throat, for I thought you must have half-killed
yourself. Get Bully Brooks and shut him up in
your room. He’s getting to be a fine mouser.
Dress yourself, honey, and look for him. I’d
bring him up for you, but your father’s waiting
for me and I must hurry. Good-by, dear. I’ll
be back in two or three hours.”</p>

<p>With anxious haste and many apprehensive
glances at the harboring closet, now closed and
locked, Charlotte dressed herself and hurried down
stairs. “Do you know where Bully Brooks is?”
she asked of Lizzie in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Dat good-fo’-nuthin’ cat?” teased Lizzie,
with a broad grin at Charlotte’s pantomimic threats
of displeasure and retaliation. “I done see him
jess now streakin’ out to’d de bahn wif his tail in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
de air, like he was totin’ a flag at de head of a
percession.”</p>

<p>Charlotte sped down the walk to the barn and
looked all about and called softly, “Bully Brooks!
Bully Brooks!” The door leading from the barn
into the woodshed was open and she thought,
“Maybe he’s gone in there.”</p>

<p>“My! What a lot of wood we’ve used this
winter!” she said to herself. “The last time I
was in here, last fall, the shed was nearly full.
And now there’s only that pile in the middle.” She
moved toward the back of the inclosure, her gaze
searching the corners, then falling upon the irregularly
piled sticks at the back of the neat cords.</p>

<p>“There he is!” she exclaimed softly, as she saw
a gray tail sticking out from between the logs.
Speedily she bore down upon him. “Here, ‘yo’
good-fo’-nuthin’ cat,’” she muttered, “come out
here.” She made a grab for his tail, but he
whisked it suddenly aside, and went on, threading
his way between the chunks of wood, his head
stretched out and nostrils working.</p>

<p>“Oh, you think you smell something, do you?
Well, just come right along with me and see what
you can smell in my room.” But she could not
quite reach him, and she began tossing to one side
the smaller sticks. In a moment her eyes fell upon
the boarding of the hidden room. “What can
that be?” she wondered, pausing in her work.
With Charlotte, to have her curiosity aroused was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
only to fire her determination to have it assuaged.
So now she eagerly threw out of the way the remaining
pieces and saw plainly the tiny house.
“There’s a door in it!” she whispered, and straight-way
stepped up and peeped in.</p>

<p>There she saw the negro runaway asleep upon
the straw pallet. On the bench were the remains
of his dinner, with pans and plates and cups which
she recognized as having come from their own
cupboard.</p>

<p>For a moment she stared, bewildered. Then,
as the boy stirred in his sleep, she picked up Bully
Brooks, shut the door softly and hurried back to
her room. Her thoughts darted at once to the
heart of the mystery.</p>

<p>“They’re stealing niggers, that’s what they’re
doing, father and Rhoda! My! It’s worse than
stealing horses, or money!” Her face was hot
with indignation and her eyes blazing. “They
ought to be arrested, even if they are my father
and sister. Why, it might be one of Jeff’s niggers
they’re stealing. Just think of it! Nigger thieves!
They ought to be punished—they deserve to go to
prison—and they would, too, if it was known!”</p>

<p>She stopped in the midst of her fuming as an
idea flashed across her mind. It took her breath
away for a moment. Then she drew back from it
with a little feeling of repugnance. But in a
moment more her busy, resentful thought was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
hovering around it, experimenting with it, considering
it with more and more of favor.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling how many slaves they’ve
hidden in there and sent on to Canada. Thousands
of dollars worth, it’s likely. And their
owners just raking the country and spending money
trying to find them. Oh, it’s a shame the way
these black abolitionists act! Father and Rhoda
are just as bad as any of them. Nigger thieves!
O, my! And that nigger out in the woodshed, he
belongs to somebody just exactly the same as if he
was a horse or a cow. He ought to be taken back.
He’s somebody’s property, and it’s wrong and
against the law to steal him, or to help anybody
else to steal him. If I don’t tell somebody that
he’s here, so he can be taken back to his owner,
I’ll be a nigger-thief, just the same as they are.”</p>

<p>She tied her bonnet under her chin, adjusted her
cape around her shoulders, took a last look in the
glass, and turned toward the door. Her eyes
chanced to fall upon the letter, lying on the table.</p>

<p>“O, my goodness, I’m about to forget that!”
she exclaimed, seizing the missive. She giggled
and tilted her chin and said aloud, “Yes, I shall,
I shall do it!” Then she touched her lips to the
superscription and airily waved the envelope toward
the south. With another gay little laugh she
tucked it into her pocket. And so it happened
that when the mail-bag left the Hillside post-office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
that afternoon it carried three letters for Jefferson
Delavan.</p>

<p>As she came out of the post-office Charlotte
found herself face to face with her admirer, Billy
Saunders. “Is Susie at home?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and expecting you. Are you going
there?” He turned and walked up the street at
her side. Her cheeks still showed a heightened
color and the fires of her indignation glowed in
her eyes. “You’re looking mighty pretty this
afternoon, Charlotte. What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“What’s happened, indeed!” Charlotte tossed
her head. “Does there have to be a wedding, or
a funeral, or a steamboat accident before I deserve
a compliment?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! You always deserve more compliments
than I have sense enough to think of.
But you look excited, as if something unusual had
happened.”</p>

<p>Charlotte turned toward him, her heart swelling
with excitement over the momentous secret she
had discovered. At this final moment it was chiefly
the childish need of sharing her knowledge that
urged her to speech. “Say, Billy, can you keep
a secret?”</p>

<p>“As well as you can, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I’ve just got to tell somebody, or I’ll fly into
a thousand pieces!”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” he begged in mock alarm.
“Out with it, and save the pieces!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Well, then, there’s a nigger in our woodpile!”</p>

<p>A flash crossed his face. “What do you mean?”
he ejaculated, stopping short.</p>

<p>“Just what I say. He’s hid among the wood in
our woodshed. There’s a little house there.”</p>

<p>“Well—” he hesitated over his answer as they
walked on. “I reckon it’s all right,” he hazarded.
But he was thinking rapidly. Here, in all likelihood,
was the proof for which the pro-slavery
sympathizers had long been watching. Dr. Ware’s
outspoken sentiments and his activity in the anti-slavery
movement had caused them to suspect
he was connected with Underground operations.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?” he asked
jocularly. “When did you see him and what was
he doing?”</p>

<p>“Do I usually dream around in the daytime,
Billy Saunders? I saw him about an hour ago and
he was sound asleep. And if you think I don’t
know a nigger when I see one you can go and look
for yourself!”</p>

<p>They had reached the Saunders gate and he
lifted his hat in farewell. “Remember you’re to
keep that secret,” she called after him, in appeasement
of a sudden compunction.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can keep a secret as well as you can,” he
laughed back. Secretly a little troubled by his
answer, but saying to herself defiantly, “Well, they
deserve whatever happens, anyway!” she went into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the house. He quickened his steps to the office of
the United States marshal.</p>

<p>At the home of Mrs. Hardaker the members of
the anti-slavery sewing circle were busy over their
needles when Rhoda, from her seat near a front
window, saw Horace dash up the street in a buggy.
Springing out, he came up the front walk almost
on a run. He saw her face at the window and
beckoned. She went out and met him at the front
door.</p>

<p>“Is there any U. G. baggage at your house,
Rhoda?” he asked at once in low, anxious tones.</p>

<p>“Yes. A young man came late last night and
has been sleeping all day.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s it! I just now discovered that
Marshal Hanscomb was on the track of something,
and I was afraid it might be there! I’ve got a case
in court that will be called in ten minutes, but I
borrowed this buggy from my client and rushed
over here. Is your father at home?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve got to go and get him away.” She
was hurrying into her bonnet and wrap.</p>

<p>“You’d better let me—”</p>

<p>“No, no. You can’t leave your case. That
would be too suspicious. I’ll manage it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t walk home—take this buggy.” They
were already rushing to the gate and he went on
as he assisted her to the seat: “There’s not a minute
to lose. Hanscomb’s getting ready now to
start out with his men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>She was soon in the cross street upon which
backed their row of outbuildings. Here a wide
door gave entrance to the woodshed. It was kept
padlocked and she had to waste a few minutes
finding Jim to unlock the door. The young negro,
dazed by this sudden awakening to danger, was
hustled into the buggy, a small, uncovered, box-seated
vehicle. Rhoda made him double up in
the little space at her feet and covered him with a
carriage rug. Then over her own lap and down
over him she spread an ample robe, which Jim
hastily tucked in at the sides.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to reach Gilbertson’s with him,” she
said to the faithful black man as the horse sprang
forward at her whip’s touch. She made a détour
around several blocks and struck into the street
leading to the country in the first valley beyond
the house. This lost several minutes at the start,
but she reflected that if the marshal should arrive
in time to see her driving straight away from
the house he might be suspicious enough to make
chase at once. As it was, one of his men, on guard
at their gate, saw her buggy as it turned from a
cross street into the country road, but, at the moment,
thought nothing of it. Looking back, she
saw the men ride up to their gate and knew that
they would search the house.</p>

<p>“They’ll have their trouble for their pains,” she
thought. “But wasn’t it a narrow chance! You
poor boy, I’m going to save you, anyway!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>She wondered what hint had come to the marshal’s
ears, and decided it must have been suspicion
rather than actual knowledge that had brought him
to search their house at this particular time. Most
likely the fugitive had been seen on his way to
their house by some of the many eyes ever on
the alert for such as he, and her father’s reputation
as a strong anti-slavery man and abolitionist had
given Marshal Hanscomb a pretext.</p>

<p>“But he’ll never think of looking in the woodpile,”
she told herself with a smile of satisfaction.
“That secret is perfectly safe, for nobody knows
it but us and Horace. Our little hiding place
will be as safe as ever, even if they do search the
house!”</p>

<p>She looked back anxiously from the top of the
high hill, whence the road entered a sparsely
wooded belt of country, and saw that the horses
were still hitched at their side gate. “I’m getting
a good start, even if they do follow me,” she reflected,
“and I guess I can make Gilbertson’s.”</p>

<p>But the horse was a slow traveler and, although
she urged him constantly with voice and whip, to
Rhoda’s anxious eyes they seemed to cover the
ground at but a snail’s pace. She thought they
must have been on the road nearly an hour when,
from the top of a long, sloping hill, she glanced
backward and saw a party of four mounted men
crossing the rise she had just left behind. She
recognized it at once as Marshal Hanscomb and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
his aids. They were riding at a much faster pace
than her horse could equal and she knew that in
a few minutes they would surely overtake her and,
in all probability, stop her and search the buggy.</p>

<p>For one brief flash the thought crossed her mind
what that would mean—arrest, trial, and afterward
imprisonment. But that fleeting picture was
instantly gone and in its place came the vision of
the lad at her feet being carried back to scourging
and slavery. As she urged the horse down the hill
at a reckless pace she remembered that he was
about to be sold “down south”—that land of fears
and terrors which to the negroes of the border
states was a doom almost as awful as was the fiery
gulf which threatened the impenitent sinner. It
occurred to her that the hill was the same one
where she had met the slave, Andrew, on that
momentous day of the previous summer.</p>

<p>“If I can make the bottom, and get him safe
on that path to the cave before they see him— O,
God, help me!” She thought of the boy’s old slave
mother, waiting and trusting for his promised help
to rescue her from bondage, and lashed her horse
again. With a firm hand she held the lines, her
eyes on the road ahead and her touch guiding the
horse along the safest track. With a jerk they
stopped short at the bottom of the hill and she
pulled away the coverings.</p>

<p>“Get up, quick!” she warned. “They’ve followed
us, and you must hide. Climb that fence—do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
you see that path over there? Run down that—it
will bring you to a thicket of hazel bushes.
Behind them, in the hill, there is a cave. You’ll
be safe there, until I or some one comes for you.
But don’t stir out of it until you hear the word,
‘Canada,’ three times. They’re right behind us—run
fast!”</p>

<p>He needed no more warning, but was over the
fence and speeding like a deer along the faint
pathway. There was no foliage now to screen his
figure and he would have to get beyond the bend
in the hill, where the path dropped downward
again, before he would be safe from sight. Rhoda
gave one quick backward glance—they had not yet
come into view. The fleeing mulatto reached the
big rock, turned it, and disappeared. With a little
catch in her breath she gathered up her lines,
straightened the carriage robes and urged her horse
forward again. There was no need of haste now,
and the sooner the interview with the marshal was
over the sooner he would go back and leave her
free to bring the boy from his hiding place and go
on her way. So she let the horse slowly climb the
rise, while she heard the pursuing party clattering
down the other slope. Presently they were beside
her.</p>

<p>“Miss Ware, by authority of the law, I shall
have to search your buggy,” said the marshal’s
voice, at the wheel. One of his men rode to the
horse’s head and seized the bridle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“What for?” she asked, with well-simulated
surprise.</p>

<p>“You are under suspicion of concealing in it
a fugitive slave. I know that he was hidden in
your woodshed”—Rhoda’s heart sank and she felt
her eyelids quiver—“as late as this afternoon. But
you got him out before we reached there, and came
out on this road by a roundabout way. We’ve
had our eyes on your father for a long time. And
now I reckon we’ve caught him, and you too!”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked at him and was able to command
a smile. “Excuse me,” she said politely, “but
how many did you say you thought I had concealed
in this buggy?”</p>

<p>“Only one,” the marshal answered curtly. “You
can get out if you want to while we examine it.”</p>

<p>She jumped to the ground and stood by, smiling,
while they took out the rugs and looked under
the seat.</p>

<p>Disappointed glances passed from one to another.
Evidently, they had felt sure they would
find the missing slave in her buggy. Rhoda took
off her wrap and shook it ostentatiously. “You
see, I haven’t got him concealed about my clothing.
You can search my pocket too, if you like,” she
added innocently.</p>

<p>“You’ve beat us this time, young lady,” he responded
angrily, “but we know what your father
is up to, and you with him, and we’ll get you yet.”</p>

<p>She turned upon him with dignity. “May I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
ask, Mr. Hanscomb, that you will finish your examination
of this little buggy where there is scarcely
room for one, as soon as possible, so that I can
go on. I am on an errand for my father, and I
would like to finish it and get home before dark.
Perhaps you would like to look under the horse’s
collar and split open the whip-stock.”</p>

<p>The marshal flushed with annoyance. “All
right. You can go on now. But you’d better be
careful about taking in any more niggers.”</p>

<p>She drove slowly on up the hill and they brought
their horses’ heads together for a conference. She
was trembling with anxiety lest it might occur to
them to search the woodland on the west of the
road, and she wanted to know what they were
going to do before she would have to pass out of
sight down the other side of the hill. To gain
time she dropped her whip, and jumped out to
get it. Then she adjusted a buckle in the harness
and examined a thill strap. A stolen glance let
her see that they were starting back toward the
town.</p>

<p>But now a new anxiety filled her. Did they
know of the cave? Would they think of it as a
possible hiding place? The cave was such a little
one,—it was of no interest to any one but children—perhaps
they had never heard of it, or had
forgotten it if they had. She longed to look
around and see if they stopped, but she feared to
show interest in their movements, lest she might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
renew their suspicions. Had the boy left footprints
as he ran from the buggy to the fence? She
tried to remember whether the ground there was
hard or muddy, but could recall nothing. In an
agony of apprehension she reached the top of the
hill and started down the descent.</p>

<p>“I must know, whatever happens,” she presently
said to herself. Stopping the horse she sprang out
and ran back a little way, to where her eyes could
command the opposite hill. The horsemen were
disappearing over its crest. Her knees were shaking
as she hurried back to the buggy, but she pulled
herself together and considered what would be the
best plan to get the fugitive out of the cave and on
to the next station. For she feared to go back
openly now, lest some member of the marshal’s
party might return. A little farther on, she remembered,
was a cross way and striking off from
this, a short distance to the westward, an old wood
road which ended near the cave. “It used to be
there,” she thought anxiously, “but I haven’t been
down it since—oh, I don’t know when! I’ll have
to take chances on its being there yet.”</p>

<p>But on the cross road she met farmer Gilbertson,
in a big, deep-bedded wagon filled with a load of
loose hay. She told him of her narrow escape.</p>

<p>“You better drive in and get him in your little
buggy,” he advised, “and I’ll wait out here and
take him home with me, under the hay. It’ll be
safe enough—this road ain’t traveled much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>It was not long until Rhoda was driving homeward
again, deep joy in her heart that the fugitive
had escaped such imminent danger, but wondering
much how the marshal had discovered the secret
of their woodshed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p>When Mrs. Ware reached home that afternoon
she found Marshal Hanscomb and his men, baffled
and angry, completing their search of the
house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hanscomb, what does this mean?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“It means that runaway niggers have been making
a hiding place of your house and that we’ve
been barely too late to catch one.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mr. Hanscomb, that nothing
of the sort has been going on in my house. Dr.
Ware’s sympathies, it is true, are with the anti-slavery
cause, but he is not a nigger-stealer.”</p>

<p>“If you think so, madam,”—there was the hint
of a sneer in his tone—“you’d better go out to the
woodshed and look at that room built into the
middle of your woodpile and see how lately it’s
been occupied.”</p>

<p>She turned upon him a face of offended dignity.
Her small, plump figure, in its balloon-like skirt,
stiffened with a haughtiness which impressed even
the angry marshal. “I trust, sir, that you have
satisfied yourself there is no one concealed in the
house or on the premises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“We have, madam, for the present. We happened
to be a few minutes too late.”</p>

<p>“Then I will bid you good-evenin’.” With a
stately nod she left him, going at once to her own
room, behind whose closed door she remained until
her husband’s return.</p>

<p>Rhoda and her father, coming from opposite
directions, drove up to their east gate at the same
moment, in the red glow of a March sunset. She
told him hurriedly of the happenings of the afternoon
and of the narrow chance by which she had
finally saved the mulatto lad from recapture. At
the veranda steps Jim met them, with an excited
account of the marshal’s visit and his search of
the house. He evidently knew of the woodshed
hiding place, the man said, for he went to it at
once.</p>

<p>“Was any one at home?”</p>

<p>“No, sah, nobody but Lizzie and me. But
Mrs. Ware, she done come before they leave.”</p>

<p>“Then she knows now,” Rhoda told herself.
“Oh, to think she had to find it out that way!”</p>

<p>They walked silently down the veranda, avoiding
each other’s eyes, and entered at the front
door. Mrs. Ware was coming down the stairs.
Rhoda stopped short, but her father walked swiftly
past her and held out his hand to his wife. She
could not see his face, but the look on her mother’s
countenance stabbed her to the heart. In it the
girl read resentful inquiry, wounded faith, reproachful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
love. They seemed oblivious of her,
as Mrs. Ware stood looking into her husband’s
face with that hurt look upon her own. She did
not take the hand he held out. Then Rhoda saw
him sweep her close to his side and heard him say
in a choking voice, “Come, Emily!” He led her
into the living-room and closed the door.</p>

<p>What passed between them there Rhoda never
knew—what confessions of outraged rights, what
heart-barings of living tenderness, what recognitions
of inner imperatives, what renewals of the
bonds of love and trust. She crouched where she
had dropped on the stair step, miserably conscious
that this was the climax of the estrangement over
her between her father and mother, feeling keenly
that it had been her mother’s right to know the use
that was being made of her home, appreciating
her father’s motive in wishing to keep it hidden,
remorseful for the wound her share in it would
deal her mother’s heart, but unable to give up one
jot of her conviction that what she and her father
had been doing had been demanded of them by
the highest laws of God and the most sacred rights
of man.</p>

<p>In a jumble of thought and feeling, swept by
waves of passionate sympathy and compassion for
both of the two within that closed door, Rhoda
sat huddled on the stairs until her mother came
out. “Mother!” she called, springing up and
holding out her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Mrs. Ware came up and took them, saying simply,
“How cold they are, honey!” and pressed
them to her breast. In the dim light the girl
could see that her face was very pale but that her
eyes were shining with calm happiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! We both felt that you ought to
know about it—”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, dear child. I would rather your
father had confided in me from the first—”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that he doubted you, mother! Oh,
don’t think that! He knew you would be loyal to
him—but he thought it might give you pain to
know—”</p>

<p>“Yes, honey, I understand—I appreciate all
that. But don’t you see, dear, I would have liked
to be trusted by my husband, even if it had hurt—a
little?”</p>

<p>“It was your right to know, mother.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I don’t think so much about that as
you would, Rhoda, but—a woman who loves needs
to feel that she is trusted as well as loved. But
it’s all right now. I know how you and your
father feel about it, that you are doing only what
seems to you right, although to me, dear child, it
seems very wrong. I don’t want to know any
more about it than I must, and you mustn’t expect
me to help you in the least, but not for the world,
dearie, would I hinder you and your father from
doing what you think is right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>Rhoda bowed her head upon her mother’s shoulder
whispering, “Dear mother!”</p>

<p>“Your father and I understand each other better now,”
Mrs. Ware went on in tender tones.
“There has been some misunderstanding between
us about you and Jeff, but this has cleared it all
up, and so I am glad it happened. He has promised
me that he will not try to influence you in
any way against marrying Jeff. So you see now,
dearie, that it is possible, after all, for husband
and wife to live together in love and trust and
happiness, even though they do hold opposite
opinions about slavery!”</p>

<p>There was a sound of quick, light footsteps
across the veranda and Charlotte came in breezily,
cheeks glowing and eyes sparkling. “What’s the
matter?” she exclaimed. “What’s happened?”
Then sudden recollection came to her of what
probably had happened and of her own share in
it, and a look of confusion crossed her face.
Rhoda saw it and instant suspicion was born in her
mind that here was the medium through which
information had reached the marshal.</p>

<p>“Sister, was it you?” she asked on the impulse,
her tone gentle but reproachful.</p>

<p>“Was what me?” Charlotte flared back.</p>

<p>“I think you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware had come out of the living-room and
was standing in the doorway. Charlotte threw at
him a coaxing, appealing glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“You’d better tell the truth about it, Charlotte,”
he responded. The girl shrank back a little at his
tone and something of surprise crossed her face.
Never before had he spoken to her with so near an
approach to sternness. His large, calm eyes were
upon her, dispassionate but disapproving. She
could not withstand their compulsion.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I did,” she exclaimed defiantly,
tossing her head as she took a step forward. “And
I think I did no more than was right and I’m glad
I did it. When people are disobeying the laws
and are criminals, even if they are your own
people—”</p>

<p>“There, child, that will do,” her father interrupted,
lifting an admonishing hand. “Remember,
please, that you are only eighteen, and that your
father is in no need of moral instruction at your
hands. I understand how you feel about this question
and I am perfectly willing for you to believe
as seems to you right. I expect you to grant the
same privilege to me and to every other member
of my family. And as long as you live under your
father’s roof, my daughter, he has the right also
to expect from you loyalty to his interests. Do
you think I shall have it hereafter?”</p>

<p>Charlotte burst into tears. In all her saucy
little life no one had ever spoken to her with such
severity. “I only told Billy Saunders,” she sobbed,
“and I told him not to tell!”</p>

<p>Instantly her father was beside her, patting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
shoulder, an arm about her waist. “There, there!”
he soothed. “I didn’t suppose you realized what
you were doing. As it happened, no great harm
came of it. Just remember, after this, that it
is not your duty to sit in judgment on my actions.
Then we shall all move along as happily as ever.”</p>

<p>When Rhoda went to her room and her eyes
fell upon her writing table, sudden misgiving
caught her breath. She had not stopped to make
it tidy, after her letter-writing in the morning,
because of her hurried departure for the sewing
circle, and its unaccustomed disorder brought
sharply to her mind the letter she had written.
And that other sheet—had she destroyed it, as she
meant to do? She looked the table over hastily,
shuffling the clean sheets of paper in her hand.
“How silly!” she thought. “Of course I destroyed
it! I remember, I picked up several sheets together
that I didn’t want, and burned them, and that was
among them!”</p>

<p>Still, for a moment, the uneasy fear persisted
that perhaps she had put it into her letter. She
burned with shame at the thought that her lover
might read those words. Then with a sudden
vault her mind faced about and she felt herself
almost exulting that at last he might know how
much she cared, that at last, in spite of herself
she had surrendered.</p>

<p>“If I did send it,” she thought as she sat at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
her window, in the dark, “he will come and I shall
have to give up.”</p>

<p>Her mother’s words recurred to her: “You see
that it is possible for husband and wife to live together
in love and trust and happiness, even though
they do hold opposite opinions about slavery.”
They would be happy—ah, no doubt about that!
And perhaps, if they were married and constantly
together, she could make Jeff see the wrongs of
slavery. She could point out to him specific instances
of injustice and rouse that side of his conscience
which now seemed to be dead. He had
such a fine, noble nature in all other things—it
was only because he had been brought up in this
belief and had always been accustomed to taking
slavery for granted. With his great love for
her she would surely be able to exert some influence
over him, and she would use it all to one end.</p>

<p>She knew of other men who had been slaveholders
but, becoming convinced that it was wrong,
had freed their slaves and joined the anti-slavery
ranks. Some, even, worked with the Underground
Railroad. What a splendid thing it would be
if she could win him over to the side of liberty!
For such a result, she told herself, she would be
willing to crucify her conscience for a little while
and be a part of the thing she abhorred.</p>

<p>She slept that night with a smile on her face
and when she wakened in the morning her first
consciousness was of an unusual lightness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
happiness in her heart. Then she remembered,
and flushed to her brows.</p>

<p>“But it was all true,” she whispered. “I didn’t
mean to send it, and I’m sure I didn’t. But I—almost—wish
I had.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p>When Jefferson Delavan received the mail containing
the three letters from Hillside his lover’s
eye saw at once the envelope bearing the handwriting
of Rhoda Ware. Everything else was
pushed aside and this was hastily torn open. He
turned the sheets over and swept them with a
hungry look, as though he would devour all their
contents at one glance. And so it happened that
before he had read another line his eyes fell upon
the page on which she had poured out her heart,
which she thought she had burned—but almost
wished she had not.</p>

<p>He had to read it twice before he could believe
that his eyes were not playing him some trick.
Then he sprang up joyously, with a great light in
his face, and ordered his horse. The rest of his
mail, even to Rhoda’s letter, was thrust into his
pocket, while he made ready for immediate
journey. Slaves went scurrying hither and thither,
urged to unaccustomed speed by their master’s
impetuous commands, and in less than half an hour
he was in his saddle.</p>

<p>He struck across the country on the turnpike
road straight for the Kentucky shore of the Ohio
river opposite Hillside. Quicker time might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
been possible by the more roundabout route by
railroad to Cincinnati, but his only thought was
that thus he was headed directly toward the white
house on the hill.</p>

<p>He galloped his horse for an hour or two before
he remembered that it would be the part of wisdom
not to take too much out of it at the start,
laughed aloud as he slowed down, slapped its neck
in sheer joy, and sang lustily the tale of “Lord
Lovell.” Then he remembered, that he had not
read the whole of Rhoda’s letter. He drew it
forth, and was reminded in so doing that he had
other letters in his pocket. But they could wait.
He plunged into hers and read it eagerly through,
dropping the bridle and allowing his horse to take
a slower pace. Now and then he smiled or gave a
little, tender laugh, as he came upon a mirthful
sally, or again he frowned thoughtfully and shook
his head at her argument. And presently he was
staring in bewilderment at the closing paragraph
with its denial of his suit. His heart sank as he
hastily searched out the other sheet for reassurance.
Yes, there it was, and there could be no mistaking
the longing call of her heart that spoke so piteously
through its brief lines.</p>

<p>“This other, she wrote with her head,” he told
himself, “and then her heart gave up and made
her write this. Ah, the dear, dear girl! It’s like
her to surrender like this, so completely, and even
against herself when she lets her heart get the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
upper hand. Oh, my arms will be all the tying
she’ll need, and there’ll be kisses enough to stop
her mouth as long as we live!”</p>

<p>With a caressing touch he put the missive away
in an inner pocket and urged his horse on again,
smiling and humming softly. At last he recalled
the other letters. Mrs. Ware’s he read first and
found in it confirmation of the view he had already
taken of Rhoda’s surprising message. The girl
was evidently longing for sight of him once more,
her mother said, and if he were to come soon
perhaps he could storm her stubborn heart. He
laughed again and exclaimed aloud, “Yes, indeed,
I’m coming, and if there’s any more storming
necessary—” and the sentence broke off into another
exultant laugh.</p>

<p>Then he bethought him of the other letter. It
was without date line or signature and with puzzled
eyes he read its few lines, in the middle of the
page: “When true hearts pine and gallants stay
away, then what can ladies do? Alas the day,
they can but pine when cruel gallants come no
more!”</p>

<p>He looked the sheet all over and examined the
envelope inside and out to find some clue to its
authorship. But there was not the least sign, and
the postmark was indistinct. It was written upon
the same kind of paper and inclosed in the same
kind of envelope as Rhoda always used, but the
handwriting was not Rhoda’s, and it seemed so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
unlike her to send such an indirect, silly little
message that he said at once, “No, it’s not from
Rhoda.” But who could there be among his
friends or acquaintance likely to take such interest
in his courtship, of which so few of them knew,
and send him this sort of romantic hint? Of
course, it might be from some friend of Rhoda’s
in whom she had confided.</p>

<p>“It must be that little rogue of a Charlotte!”
he presently exclaimed. “She has sharp eyes in
her head, that’s plain enough, always, and she
has seen how it is with her sister and thought she
might help things along by giving me a hint. Bless
her heart! She’s a dear little thing, if she does
like to flirt, and after Rhoda and I are married
we’ll bring her down to Fairmount and give her
the best time she’s had in all her life and perhaps
marry her to Lloyd Corey or Frank Morehead.”</p>

<p>While this was not the outcome of her anonymous
message which Charlotte hoped to bring
about when she penned it, she would perhaps have
been as willing to accept it, had her thoughts
ranged so far ahead, as the one she planned to
compass. Nor would she have been taken aback
had she known, while she fluttered about on the
tiptoe of expectancy for whatever might happen,
with what ardor Jefferson Delavan’s thoughts were
turning toward Rhoda on his northward ride.</p>

<p>If her missive induced him to come again to
their house what did it matter whether he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
its words referred to Rhoda or to some one else?
Since Rhoda was determined she would not marry
him, he would soon find out his mistake and would
be quite willing to look for consolation elsewhere.
Had he not shown her every attention on the trip
to Cincinnati? And when had she failed to set
a man’s heart aflame, if she had really wanted to
witness the conflagration? Let her once more
have the opportunity—and she smiled at the brown
eyes reflected back from her mirror, confident that
they had lost none of their power.</p>

<p>He would be able to reach the Ohio river by
the morrow’s night, Delavan thought, and the
next morning he would cross over and hasten up
the hill to claim the sweet promise that beckoned
to him from that glimpse of Rhoda’s secret heart.
As he mused over her words, and the wonder of it
that she should at last have called him, it occurred
to him that perhaps she had not meant to put that
sheet into her letter. Perhaps she had merely
written down that revelation of her feelings as
ease to her own aching heart. But he laughed
joyously.</p>

<p>“She’s let me know how it is with her, whether
she meant to send it or not, and I’ll do just as she
begs me to, this time!”</p>

<p>And so he urged his horse onward, his glowing
heart beating high in his breast, sure of the happiness
waiting for him at the end of his journey,
and counting off the lessening hours that lay between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
him and the banks of the river. But that
night there came a violent rainstorm that carried
away bridges and left swollen streams rushing
through overflowed valleys. It delayed him two
days, so that it was not until the sixth day after
Rhoda penned her letter that he reached Hillside.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the Supreme Court had
announced its decision in the Dred Scott case, delighting
the South, staggering the North, and
fanning to still higher and hotter flame the fires
of contention over the ever-burning question of
slavery. Jefferson Delavan heard the news as
he fumed over his delay, storm-bound in the hotel
of a country town. He and half a dozen other
slave owners from the town and near-by plantations,
who dropped into the hotel during the
evening, rejoiced over the victory as they sat
around a bowl of punch.</p>

<p>“This will put an end to the whole controversy
and give the country peace at last,” said Delavan.</p>

<p>“It knocks the feet from under the Republican
party,” declared another. “They’ll be capable
of no more mischief now!”</p>

<p>“Yes, gentlemen,” exclaimed a third, “it surely
ties the hands of the northern fanatics. They can
no longer stop our growth!”</p>

<p>“Under the protection of this decision,” Delavan
followed on, “we can take our slaves wherever
we like, and, with the northern Democracy becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
more and more favorable to us, we shall
soon win back the ground we have lost!”</p>

<p>“Nor will our growth be all in that direction!”
said another, slowly and significantly.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” was Delavan’s quick response.
“Mexico and Central America will be ours for
the taking as soon as we realize our strength.
Gentlemen!” He sprang to his feet, his face
glowing with enthusiasm, his glass held high.
“Gentlemen, I give you a toast: To the Republic
of the South, our own fair Land of Dixie, firm
footed on the foundation of slavery, and spreading
wide wings North, South, East and West; her
day shall come soon and endure forever!”</p>

<p>With shouts of approval the others were on their
feet at once, drinking the toast, cheering the sentiment,
and waving hats, pipes, glasses, whatever
their hands could seize. And no ghost of a misgiving
visited Jefferson Delavan, in the midst of
their exultant rejoicing, as to how that decision
might affect his personal fate.</p>

<p>To Rhoda Ware, as she looked back upon them,
the days following that of her adventure with the
negro lad were like a beautiful dream. After her
one moment of apprehension she did not believe
that she had put into her letter the telltale sheet
whereon she had poured out her heart. She was
sure she had burned it. But that instant of anxious
fear that her lover would read her confession had
given to her traitor heart its opportunity. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
brief respite of secret rejoicing she had allowed
it to take, it had leaped to the saddle and it would
not give up again to her mind and conscience the
right of command. So she submitted to the sway
of her love and battled with it no more.</p>

<p>“He will know—he will feel it, even though
I didn’t send what I wrote,” she whispered to herself.
“And if he doesn’t come soon, I will write
to him—and tell him—yes, I’ll tell him to come!”</p>

<p>She spent much time alone in her room, seated
at a southern window that commanded a view of
the street leading up from the steamboat landing,
the little bundle of letters and the faded rose held
caressingly in her hands. It happened that no
fugitives came to their door during this time, or
she might have suffered sudden awakening from
her dream.</p>

<p>As it was, she thought of nothing but the coming
of her lover and her surrender to his suit. Now
and then her reverie strayed on into the future
and she pictured their life together in Jeff’s beautiful
home at Fairmount, with the slaves all freed
and giving faithful service for wages. Staying so
much apart and living in her own rose-colored
dreams, the strenuous enthusiasms of the recent
months, even her immediate surroundings, seemed
to lose their reality. The same emotional force in
her character which enabled her to enter with
such zeal into the anti-slavery work and to be
so absorbed by it that she could sacrifice her love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
upon its altar made it possible now,—indeed,
made it inevitable,—when she had once given up
to the opposing influence, that she should be swept
by its forceful current to the other extreme.</p>

<p>A new expression came into her face. Her
dreams drew a soft and tender veil across the usually
intent and serious look of her eyes, and all her
countenance glowed with her inner happiness. Her
mother saw the change in expression and demeanor
with inward delight. For when it came to the
affections Mrs. Ware was able to interpret her
daughter’s feelings and actions with more surety
than in matters of the mind and conscience.</p>

<p>Charlotte, in whose heart rankled resentment
against her father and sister for their anti-slavery
views, their Underground work, and the reproach
that had been administered to her, noted the new
look on Rhoda’s face and said bitterly to herself:
“Yes, I suppose she’s getting hold of a whole pack
of niggers to steal and send on to Canada!” She
told herself petulantly that she was no longer of
any consequence in their home and began to feel
an angry sense of injury at the bonds tacitly imposed
upon her conduct by the ideas and actions
of her father and sister. She longed for some
happening that would take her away and put her
into surroundings where she could feel her accustomed
sense of freedom and personal importance.</p>

<p>And so, the wish being father to the conviction,
Charlotte felt every day more and more sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
that Jefferson Delavan would soon reappear, that
Rhoda would refuse him again, and that then she
could capture his repulsed heart and speedily win
from him a proposal of marriage. She would
hold him off a little while, and make him all the
more eager—that would be easy enough—and
when at last she did consent, he would of course
want an early marriage, and to that, too, she
would reluctantly consent—“Oh, the sooner the
better,” her thoughts broke into sudden storm,
“so that I can get away from this black abolition
hole!”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware observed with surprise the look upon
his daughter’s face and the change in her manner.
He felt the lessening of her ardor in their mutual
interests and was not slow to attribute her silence,
her drawing away from the life of the household
and her self-absorbed, dreamlike demeanor to its
true cause.</p>

<p>“Something has happened,” he said to himself,
“that, for the time being, has made her give up the
struggle against her heart, and, like a river that
has burst through its dam, her love is overflowing
everything else in her nature. Well, I’m glad
Delavan isn’t here now, and I hope her conscience
will get its head above water again before she
sees him. The good Lord grant that something
happens to bring her back to herself before it’s too
late!”</p>

<p>But he said nothing to his daughter, faithfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
observing the pledge he had made to his wife at
their recent reconciliation. Nor did he and Mrs.
Ware speak to each other about it, although it
was uppermost in both their thoughts. The renewed
tenderness between them was too sacred
for either to dare the risk of marring its bloom
by even so much as an allusion to a subject upon
which they were so widely divided.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of her surrender Rhoda sat
at her window reading a letter from her friend,
Julia Hammerton. Her active spirit was beginning
to bestir itself again and as she finished the
epistle she stretched her arms above her head and
with a little frown remembered that she had that
morning neglected one of her usual duties. Then,
“Dear me,” she exclaimed, “I’ve forgotten all
about that for— Oh, it must be several days! I
suppose mother has attended to it,” she rebuked
herself, and then smiled tenderly at the sunshine
which filled all her inner consciousness.</p>

<p>“I’ve been very happy, these days,” she thought,
“but I’m afraid I’ve been awfully lazy and selfish
too. I must go down now and get to work.”</p>

<p>She looked out of the window and saw Horace
Hardaker and the elder Kimball, father of Walter
and Lewis, coming up the hill. Her thought reverted
to the missive from Horace’s sister.</p>

<p>“I’ll take Julia’s letter down and read it to
them. There’s such a lot of news from Kansas
in it that will interest them. Dear Julia! Horace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
ought to be proud of her—and he is, I know.
She’s been so brave and so true!”</p>

<p>The hint of a shadow crossed her face as she
looked absently at the letter in her hand. From
somewhere far back in her mind seemed to come
a faint question, Had she also been true? But she
lifted her head proudly with the quick answering
thought:</p>

<p>“Of course I am true. I shall not change my
convictions the least little bit, even if I do marry
Jeff. And perhaps I can do more good as his
wife than I could in any other way.”</p>

<p>“As the mistress of slaves!” came back the
accusing whisper.</p>

<p>In the office she found her father and the two
others deeply engrossed in conversation, their
looks anxious and gloomy, but their manner showing
excitement.</p>

<p>“Come in, Rhoda,” said Dr. Ware, as she hesitated
at the door, “and hear the bad news.”</p>

<p>“Bad news! Oh, father, what is it?”</p>

<p>“The Supreme Court has decided the Dred Scott
case and the result is even worse than we have
feared. Chief Justice Taney has dragged his
official robes through slavery filth and given to
the pro-slaveryites everything they want!”</p>

<p>“Oh, father—Horace! What does he say?”</p>

<p>“The decision is,” answered Hardaker, “that
a slave cannot be a citizen—practically, that a
nigger has no rights a white man is bound to respect—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Congress has no right to prohibit
slavery in the territories, and that therefore the
Missouri Compromise is unconstitutional and
void.”</p>

<p>“It knocks the very breath out of the Republican
party,” added Dr. Ware. “Its existence is
based on the effort to get Congress to forbid slavery
in the territories. So, now—where is it?
Where are we?”</p>

<p>“We are done for, all of us,” said Kimball, in
hopeless tones. “It has knocked the footing from
under the whole anti-slavery fight. It binds us
hand and foot, and it looks now as if we might
as well stop fighting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Kimball!” Rhoda exclaimed.
“Don’t say that! We must keep on fighting as
long as there’s one of us left!”</p>

<p>“She’s right, Kimball!” said Dr. Ware, his
glance resting for a moment upon his daughter’s
face. She looked up in some confusion at having
broken in so abruptly, and met his eyes. Cool
and clear, they seemed to be looking into her very
heart and down in their gray depths as they turned
away she felt rather than saw a gleam of gratification.
The hot blood flushed her face, and conscience,
that had just now barely stirred under its
rose-leaf coverlet, roused and began to tell her that
she too must keep on fighting. Had her father
guessed how near she had been to deserting their
cause, she wondered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Yet, she’s right,” Dr. Ware was repeating,
with a thump of his fist on the table. “We’ve
got to find standing ground somewhere, and somehow
keep up the fight!”</p>

<p>“Their next step will be to reopen the slave
trade—they’re demanding that already,” Kimball
went on. “And then we shall have once more all
the horrors of the slave ships sheltered under the
law and people taught to regard the traffic as right
because it is legal.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” broke in Hardaker, “that’s the worst
of these legalized wrongs—the way they debauch
the consciences of people. Look at the way the
northern Democrats are defending the right of
property in slaves! A few years ago they admitted
slavery was wrong, but said it was here and
so we must make the best of it. Now they say it
is all right and must be protected and are tumbling
over one another in their eagerness to give the
South everything she wants!”</p>

<p>“Well, this decision gives her everything she
wants now, and opens the door for her to take
anything else she may want later.”</p>

<p>Kimball’s thin old hands were clenched together
and his gray-bearded face was sad with the hopelessness
of age. For thirty years he had been
fighting with all his strength in the cause of the
slave and he had seen the anti-slavery sentiment
grow from the conviction of a mere handful of
people to the determination of a mighty multitude.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
And now, when at last it seemed as if they had
almost reached the point where at least the thing
could be penned up in small space and its political
power taken from it, now had come this deadly
blow, to nullify every effort they could make.</p>

<p>Rhoda knew what long years of endeavor and
sacrifice he had spent in the anti-slavery cause and
how ardent had been his hope that he might live
to see slavery ended and the whole country made
free. She watched him now, her cheeks flushing
and her heart responding with full sympathy to
the grief and despair that filled his breast.</p>

<p>“If Congress,” he went on bitterly, “must recognize
and defend the master’s right to his slave
wherever he takes him, then there can be no hindrance
to slavery in any part of this country, and
Toombs and Davis and all the rest of them can yet
call the roll of their slaves in the shadow of Bunker
Hill monument, or any place else they wish. That,
my friends, is what this decision means!”</p>

<p>His voice trembled and Rhoda saw in his eyes
the tears of an old man whose dearest hope had
come to naught. She was conscious of a remorseful
shame, as though she herself had been in some
measure responsible for his grief and despair. For
had she not, was her swift, self-accusing thought,
been ready to compromise with this monster?</p>

<p>“No, no, Mr. Kimball, you mustn’t give up
like that,” Hardaker was exclaiming, “not while
there’s one of us left to die fighting. And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
election last fall showed that there are more than
a million of us, who at least are ready to help.
Rhoda’s got the right idea,” and he looked at her
with smiling approval.</p>

<p>Again she blushed and turned her eyes away,
feeling acutely that she did not deserve this praise
and miserably wondering if they would despise
her were she to tell them that she had been willing,
only an hour before, to become a slaveholder’s
wife.</p>

<p>“It seem to me,” Horace went on, “that we’ve
got to go right on with the popular propaganda
against slavery. Why, this very decision of Chief
Justice Taney—it’s so atrocious and inhuman, it
will be the best campaign document we’ve ever
had. We ought to circulate it by the thousand!
I’m not sure, friends, but it will be a good thing
for us, in the long run!”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware smiled slightly. He was accustomed
to the enthusiasm with which Hardaker, in a dozen
sentences, could convince himself of the truth of a
proposition which, five minutes before, he would
have flouted. Nevertheless, this idea appealed
to him.</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal in that, Horace,” he acquiesced,
“and I think we’d better take it up in the
Rocky Mountain Club. But while we’re appealing
to the northern voters we mustn’t forget the South.
We must extend and increase our Underground
work, because it is making slave property most precarious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
all along the border states. The more
slaves we can run off the more uncertain the whole
institution becomes, and the more angry we make
the South—and there’s nothing irritates them so
much as this—the sooner the crisis will come.
War is the only possible solution of this problem,
friends. So I say, let’s bring on the crisis as soon
as possible, and fight it out!”</p>

<p>At that moment there was a knock at the office
door and a request for Dr. Ware’s services in
another part of the town. The two visitors went
down the hill again and Rhoda, invited by the
bright sunshine, strolled down the veranda and
across the yard to the grape arbor. She wanted to
be alone and think matters over, find where she
stood and allay the turmoil between her heart and
her conscience.</p>

<p>As she walked down the path she saw that Jim
was already making preparations for the spring.
This great bed was to be filled again with white
petunias—they had liked it so much last year.
Again she seemed to sense their odor, as on that
June night, and to hear a voice vibrant with tones
of love. No, she could not think here,—her heart
would not let her. She turned away and hurried
to her room. But there too every inch of space
was like a seductive voice calling to her with the
memories of the last few days. With a sudden
grip upon herself—a quick indrawing of breath
and a pressure of teeth upon her lip, the outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
signs of inner process of taking herself in hand—she
went deliberately downstairs and out into
the woodshed.</p>

<p>There she sat down upon a chunk of wood and
faced the little room, with its door heedlessly exposed
and open, just as the marshal had left it.
The sight stung her, as she had known it would,
with an accusation of apostasy. But her spirit
rose up quickly in self-defense.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t desert our cause, even in thought,”
she declared to herself. “I’m not so bad as that,
I hope. I only thought I could marry Jeff and
still help it along. But I’m afraid I couldn’t.
Yes, I know what mother said, and for a little
while it did seem possible—just because I wanted
it so much, I suppose. But mother and I are so
different. I couldn’t be in the midst of things that
I thought were wrong without trying to make them
right. Jeff would free his slaves if I asked him to—I’m
sure he would.”</p>

<p>She lingered over the thought a moment and
a fond smile curved her lips. “Yes, I’m sure he
would, and I wouldn’t have to be a mistress of
slaves. But that isn’t the whole of it. He told
me once, and it’s been in all his letters, how wrapped
up he is in the interests of the South. And
that means slavery. It’s his own section and what
they think are their rights, against all the rest of
us and against freedom, and eternal right, and the
upward progress of the world. We’d still be just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
as much divided and opposed to each other as
ever.”</p>

<p>The memory returned to her of her father sitting
at his desk, his face drawn with sadness and
sadness in his voice, as she had seen him on that
evening in the previous autumn when she had
asked if her mother could not be told what they
were doing. She shivered a little.</p>

<p>“No, I shouldn’t like to think of my husband
feeling like that, knowing that he couldn’t tell me
of his dearest hopes and plans and ambitions, and
feel sure of my sympathy. No, that wouldn’t be
being married, really married.”</p>

<p>A little longer she sat with her chin in her hand
and stared at the open door of the tiny room. Her
face gradually took on a stern expression that
made it, notwithstanding its youthful smoothness,
curiously like her father’s.</p>

<p>“No,” she said aloud as she rose, “it can’t be.
It’s just as impossible still as it has been all the
time—even if I did think for a little while—”</p>

<p>Her face suddenly melted into tenderness and
her voice sank to a whisper. “It was a lovely
dream while it lasted, and I’m glad—it didn’t do
anybody, not even me, any harm, and I’m glad—yes,
I’m glad—I had it!” The little lines at the
corners of her mouth deepened, her upper lip lifted,
and her flashing smile lit up her countenance and
shone in her eyes. “It’s almost like looking back
on having been married for a little while!” she
thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>“Rhoda,” called Mrs. Ware from the veranda
steps, “will you come here, please?”</p>

<p>Rhoda was standing between the rows of lilac
that hedged the walk to the front gate, inspecting
the swelling buds and saying to herself with pleasure
that they looked as if they would bloom early
that year. The lilac was her best-loved flower
and these two lines of bushes had been planted
because of her pleading, ten years before. Every
season she watched anxiously for the buds to show
sign of returning life, and Charlotte declared that
after they began to swell she measured them with
a tape line every day to mark their growth. When
they bloomed she kept bowls of the flowers all
over the house and was rarely without a spray
in her hair or her dress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware noted that her daughter’s step was
not as brisk as usual and saw that the glow was
gone from her face, while into her eyes had come a
look of wistfulness. Believing she knew the cause,
she longed to take the girl in her arms and say,
“Don’t worry, dear. He’ll be here soon, I’m
sure, for I wrote to him to come.” But she
thought it best to keep her own secrets and so what
she said was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Mrs. Winston has just sent word that little
Harriet is worse and she wants your father to
come at once. He’s not likely to be back here
before noon. So I want you to drive me over to
their house and then take the message to your
father—I know where he is—so he can stop there
before he comes home. Get ready at once, honey.
I’ve told Jim to harness up, and I’ve only to put
on my bonnet.”</p>

<p>Charlotte watched them as they drove down the
hill, thinking discontentedly, “Mother doesn’t care
half as much about me as she does about Rhoda.
She’d just give her eyes to have Rhoda marry
Jeff, and she never shows the least interest that
way in me. I don’t believe she’d care if I was to
be an old maid. An old maid! Oh, la! Well,
I’m not going to, and I’ll not marry anybody in
Hillside, either.”</p>

<p>Looking rather pleased with herself at this ultimatum
she sauntered into the house and the notes
of the “Battle of Prague” were soon resounding
through the silent rooms. But the clanging of the
knocker at the front door presently crashed them
into discord. A moment later she crossed the hall
into the parlor, whither Lizzie had shown Jefferson
Delavan, thinking:</p>

<p>“What good luck there’s nobody at home but
me! I wish Rhoda had refused him again first.
Well, I’ll tell him she’s going to.”</p>

<p>A twinkle of amusement came now and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
into Delavan’s eyes as he watched the airs and
graces, the sidelong glances, and all the dainty
feminine tricks of movement and gesture and poise
with which Charlotte accompanied her conversation.
It was not her physical habit ever to remain
quietly seated, or even in the same position for
more than a few minutes. Her restless spirits,
her active body and her native vivacity of manner
combined to keep her in motion almost as incessant
and quite as unconscious as that of a bird flitting
about in a tree. Although she did not know it
this habit was one of her most charming characteristics.
She had a certain dignity of carriage, like
her mother’s, which made itself manifest, notwithstanding
her absurdly large hoopskirt, and this,
with her grace of action and of posture, made
her movements always pleasing to look at, while
her bird-like flights gave an elusiveness to her manner
that enhanced her charm.</p>

<p>She saw the admiration in Delavan’s face as
his eyes followed her, and tilted her skirts in a way
that would have scandalized her mother, although
she observed that her companion seemed not at
all dismayed by the glimpses of slender foot and
ankle that she made possible. That occasional
twinkle of amusement she took as a tribute to her
gaiety and laughed and chattered all the more.</p>

<p>“Has your true heart been pining, Miss Charlotte?”
he presently asked in a quizzical tone, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
he leaned upon the back of her chair, looking down
smilingly into her pretty, upturned face.</p>

<p>She flushed a little, but made wide eyes at him
and said, “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was given to understand that some hearts
in Hillside are in a rather bad way. Is yours true
and does it pine?”</p>

<p>She made a graceful little gesture and turned
upon him with a merry face and a look distinctly
provocative: “Suppose it was, either or both, what
would it matter to you?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, smiling, with saucy lips
and inviting eyes, and before she knew what he
was doing he had slipped an arm around her
waist and lifted her to her feet. She struggled to
free herself, but he held her against his breast,
pushed back her head and kissed her squarely upon
the lips, once, twice, and thrice. With her hands
against his chest she tried to push him away and
struggled to turn her face from his. But she was
helpless in his grasp until he released her.</p>

<p>“You brute!” she exclaimed, dashing the angry
tears from her eyes. “How dare you!”</p>

<p>He leaned against the back of the chair, hand in
pocket, and laughed indulgently. “Didn’t you
want me to? It looked that way.”</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t,” she stormed. “You’re
a horrid thing, and I hate you!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to know you didn’t. It’s much
better that you were only pretending.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“How do you think Rhoda will take it, when I
tell her? And I shall!”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell her if you like. But how do <i>you</i> think
she will take your trying to persuade a kiss from
her lover?”</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed angrily and she stamped her
foot, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Never mind, little sister,” he went on, patting
her shoulder. “I was only giving you a lesson,
and it’s much better to keep such things in the
family. Remember after this that if you ask a
man so plainly to kiss you he’s very likely to do
it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me ‘sister,’ you horrid thing! I’m
not!” she exclaimed, turning away.</p>

<p>“I hope you will be some day.”</p>

<p>“I won’t! Rhoda isn’t going to marry you!”</p>

<p>“So she’s told me a number of times!” and he
laughed again, an easy, happy, self-satisfied laugh.</p>

<p>She faced about, curiosity in her heart. Had
something happened without her knowledge?
Would he seem so sure, would he wear openly that
look of confident love if Rhoda had not accepted
him? The imp of mischief stirred once more in
her breast. She moved a step nearer.</p>

<p>“Say, do you know, Jeff, that’s the first time a
man ever kissed me!”</p>

<p>“You’ve had better luck than you deserve, little
sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“If you’re so much in love with Rhoda what did
you want to do it for?”</p>

<p>“Why did you look as if you wanted me to if
you didn’t?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t look that way!”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t you? Then my previous observations
have been at fault. Perhaps I thought I’d
like to find out why you sent me that anonymous
letter. At first I thought you meant it as a hint
for Rhoda’s sake. But after you’d been five minutes
in this room it seemed to me that you were
taking very queer means for advancing her interests.
If you had unfortunately fallen in love with
me yourself it wouldn’t have been quite so bad.
But you haven’t, little sister, you haven’t. You’d
have wanted me to kiss you again if you had.”</p>

<p>“You’re a horrid brute, that’s what you are,
and I hate you!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear it, for I’ve always liked
you, and you’re Rhoda’s sister. But I hope you’ll
remember that treachery isn’t a nice thing, in either
love or war.”</p>

<p>She moved uncertainly toward the door and,
glancing through the window, saw her sister drive
past the front gate. “There’s Rhoda!” she exclaimed,
casting back at him a fiery glance. “I
shall tell her just the sort of man you are!” But
she did not forget to give her hoopskirt an extra
tilt as she dashed out. Delavan, noting it, smiled
as he followed her to the door and cast a glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
after her figure, hurriedly retreating up the stairs.</p>

<p>Rhoda did not know that Jeff was there until she
came into the hall through the office and saw him
standing in the parlor door. “Sweetheart!” he
called in low tones, and moved toward her, with
outstretched hand. A glad light came into her
face at sight of him, but she stood still and did
not speak, until he was at her side.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Jeff! When I have told you so many
times it can’t be!” she pleaded, and drew away
from him as he would take her in his arms.</p>

<p>“I know, dearest! But it’s different now, when
I know what you really want!”</p>

<p>She turned so that he could not see her face and
asked with a sort of gasp, “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>If he could have seen her countenance as she
stood with face averted, finger on lip, listening
breathlessly for his reply, nothing would have prevented
him from seizing her in his arms and doing
as she had begged in the letter she had not meant
him to see. For it glowed with love and trembled
upon surrender and shone with gladness that he
knew her inmost heart.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rhoda Ware, I know your secret now!”
He was bending near her, his hands hovering over
her, but still he would not touch her while she
seemed unwilling. “I know, now, how much you
love me, and how ready at last you are to give
up to your heart. Come then, dear one, or I shall
surely do as you bade me in your letter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>A sudden stiffening and shrinking in her attitude
made him fall back a step and look at her anxiously.
Slowly, very slowly, she turned, lifting her
head, until she faced him. And slowly the love-light
and the trembling nearness to surrender
faded out of her countenance and left it drawn
with the effort by which she had forced herself
once more to the point of denial, with lips compressed
and gray eyes steely with resolution.</p>

<p>“Jeff,” she began, and her voice was unsteady,
“it’s not fair to either of us that you saw what
I wrote. I didn’t mean to put that into my letter—I
wrote it out only because my heart ached so
and it seemed some relief. But I thought I’d
burned it. I’m sorry it got mixed in with the other
sheets. But it was a mistake, and you’ll forgive
me, won’t you, dear Jeff, and you won’t feel that
it was a promise?”</p>

<p>Her voice fell away into pleading tones and
she stood hesitating, poised, as if wishing him to
stand aside and let her pass. With instinctive
deference he stepped aside and she moved quickly
to the foot of the stairs. But he sprang after her
and seized her hand, exclaiming, as he drew her
into the parlor, “No, Rhoda! I shall not let you
ruin both our lives and break both our hearts,
after that glimpse you gave me of yours!”</p>

<p>She steadied herself for the struggle she knew
must come, and suddenly felt her nerves grow firm
and her brain clear, as they always did when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
faced great need. She was calmer than he and
more mistress of herself as she said:</p>

<p>“I can’t say anything different to what I’ve always
said, and said in that letter, that I feel to the
bottom of my heart that slavery is such a wrong,
such a curse, such a horrible thing that I can’t
marry you because you believe in it and are a part
of it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_250.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">“‘Don’t, Jeff, please don’t!’ she pleaded.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her silently a moment, and the love
in his face, that had but just now been more of the
body than of the soul, was transfused with admiration
of her spirit. “And you can still say
that to me,” he marveled in hushed accents, “after
your heart has ached as it must have when you
wrote those lines?”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes lest he see the sudden
start of tears. It was a subtle undermining of her
defenses, had he known it, thus to cease demanding
and reveal such understanding and sympathy. Of
such sort was her ideal love, and it hurt more than
ever to put it from her. One hand was pressed
against her heart, as if she could thus lessen the
physical pain, and she said piteously, “It’s aching
now, Jeff!”</p>

<p>He looked at her irresolutely. Her drooping
figure, her averted face, her trembling voice—they
were all such a plea of weakness to strength, of
feminine trust to masculine power to help, that
even if he had not loved her the impulse to take
her in his arms and comfort her would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
well-nigh overpowering. But he knew not what
unexpected visage her spirit might next reveal and
he had already learned that, although the primitive
woman in her might call loudly one moment,
in the next the civilized woman would thrust her
into her cave and in dignity and strength stand
guard at the door. For a moment he wavered,
then with clenched hands turned on his heel and
walked across the room, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“And you won’t let me stop it, you won’t let
me comfort you!” Then he faced about and as
his eyes fell again upon her, he cried, “By heaven,
I will!” And he sprang toward her.</p>

<p>But already she had gathered up her resolution
once more and it was the civilized woman, not to be
won save with her own consent, who moved aside
and eluded the embrace with which he would have
swept her to his breast. He dropped on his knees
at her feet and buried his face in her dress. A
moment she stood with both hands clenched against
her heart. Then she bent over him and laid them
as softly upon his head as a compassionate mother
might have done.</p>

<p>“Don’t Jeff, please don’t!” she pleaded. “It’s
so hard already—don’t make it harder, for both
of us. We’ll have to just recognize what is, and
accept it.”</p>

<p>He rose again, seizing one of her hands as it
fell from his head. “But what is, Rhoda, except
that we love each other with such strength that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
God who made us must have meant us to be
husband and wife? What else is there that matters,
beside that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you so often, dear, what it is that
matters!”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do, dear heart?
I’ll free my slaves, if you wish, and pay them
wages.”</p>

<p>Her face lighted and she smiled wistfully at
him, but shook her head. “It’s deeper than that,
Jeff, deeper than just the ownership of a few slaves.
I knew you would do that, for my sake. I told
myself so—” she broke off, smiled fondly upon
him, then laid her free hand upon the two already
clasped.</p>

<p>“Listen, Jeff, let me tell you—I didn’t intend
to, but perhaps it’s best. After I sent you that
last letter, I had a sudden fear that I had put in
the sheet I didn’t mean you to see. It was only
a second, and then I felt sure I had burned it.
But for a little while I—I almost wished I had,
and in my heart I said I would give up and that
I would write you to come. It seemed as if you
would know anyway, and as if you were coming,
without my telling you. And for three or four
days I sat at my window and watched for you and
dreamed about our love, and about our life together
at beautiful Fairmount—” she hesitated
an instant and blushed faintly, but the true woman
in her sent her on—“with our children growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
up around us, and we so happy and growing old
together— Oh, Jeff, it was such a beautiful
dream!”</p>

<p>“Not half so beautiful or happy as the reality
would be, sweetheart! Oh, Rhoda, won’t you
make it true!”</p>

<p>“We’d be happy for a while, dear, but we’d
wake up, sooner or later, just as I did, and then
we’d find out that there was no true marriage between
us, and our happiness would end.”</p>

<p>Denial was in his face and voice as he quickly
answered: “Never, Rhoda! I can’t believe it!
Why should we waken? Why did you?”</p>

<p>“It was the Dred Scott decision.”</p>

<p>He smiled incredulously. “I suppose I would
have anyway, after a little,” she went on, “if you
hadn’t got here first—” and she smiled up at him
ingenuously.</p>

<p>“O, how I wish I had! If it hadn’t been for
that storm—”</p>

<p>“It’s better to wake up too soon than too late,”
she broke in. “As soon as I knew about that decision
and all that the chief justice had said, and
understood how delighted the South is over it,
and how it has saddened and discouraged all of
us up here at the North who hate slavery, then I
saw once more that I couldn’t compromise with
my conscience, not the least little bit.”</p>

<p>“But, Rhoda, you won’t have to, if I free my
slaves. And I will!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“I’ve thought that all out, and it wouldn’t help
us any—though I’d be glad for the slaves. Don’t
you see, Jeff, that if you should free them, still
believing in slavery as you do, and still being devoted
to the South and wanting with all your soul
to further her interests, which you think are bound
up in slavery—don’t you see that after a while you
would begin to feel that for my sake you had
done something wrong, had been false to your
own ideals? And I would know it and it would
make me unhappy. I don’t think, Jeff, that I’d
want you to free your negroes, except as you might
be convinced that it’s wrong to keep them enslaved.”</p>

<p>She stopped and looked up at him with her
flashing smile. “I’ll run every one of them off to
freedom that I can get a chance to, but—”</p>

<p>He smiled back at her indulgently, and then
they both laughed a little, glad of the relief from
the high tension which had held them.</p>

<p>“Rhoda, you are such a dear girl!” he murmured
fondly. Her hands were imprisoned, one
in each of his, but he did not attempt to lessen the
distance between them. The earthly side of their
love was fading out of their mutual consciousness,
for the moment, as their thoughts mounted to the
things of the spirit.</p>

<p>“It’s such a wide gulf between us, although we
are so near,” she went on. “Your letters have
shown me that. To the bottom of your heart you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
believe that all that the South is struggling for
is right and good and is her just right and will be
for the good of the world.”</p>

<p>He threw back his head and his eyes shone. “I
do, Rhoda,” he exclaimed with emphasis. “I love
the South, and her ideals are mine and her ambitions
are mine! They are just and right and
the more widely they are spread the better it will
be for civilization and the whole world!”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Yes, I understand how you feel,
though I didn’t at first. And I believe to the
bottom of my heart that the enslavement of man
by man”—her face was glowing now with the
inner fires of conviction and her low voice thrilled
with the intensity of her feeling—“is wrong and
degrades both of them and is the cause of no end
of horrible things. And I don’t believe that anything
good can ever come out of it.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know, Rhoda—you never have
seen—” he began earnestly.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I have seen, Jeff,” she broke in sadly.
“I’ve seen the poor negroes that my father and I
have helped on their way to Canada taking such
desperate risks and enduring such awful sufferings
in the hope of winning their freedom that I don’t
need to see anything else. Divided like that, dear,
on a matter that goes so deep with both of us, there
could be no real understanding and sympathy between
us, no true marriage. I think your convictions
and your ideals are wrong—they are hateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
to me—but I honor you for being true to them.
I honor you more and love you more than I would
if you gave them up, while you still believed in
them, for love of me.”</p>

<p>“You are right, dear heart,” he said, the pain
of baffled and hopeless love sounding in his voice.
“I could not be false to my convictions and my
principles, even for you, my sweet, any more than
you could be false to yours. You make me understand,
as I haven’t before, what this means to you.”</p>

<p>“No, Jeff, I can’t see that there’s any hope for
us, for our happiness, on this earth, as long as
this thing lasts that lies between us. Perhaps, in
heaven—”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and her voice trembled and
ceased. They stood with hands clasped, looking
through open windows into each other’s souls, gazing
deep into the warm and lovely depths of love,
which they were putting behind them, and turning
their vision upward along the heights where material
aims crumbled away and hope and aspiration
became only the essence of the soul’s ideals. And
as they gazed it seemed to them that somewhere
up in that dim region of eternal truth their spirits
met and were joined.</p>

<p>A faint sigh fluttered from Rhoda’s lips. With
a start Delavan dropped her hands and sank upon
the sofa beside them. His head bowed on his
breast and a deep, shuddering breath, that was
almost a sob, shook his body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“I think I’ll go now,” said Rhoda tremulously.</p>

<p>“No, don’t go. I want you beside me a little
while. Sit down here. No, don’t be afraid—give
me your hand.”</p>

<p>For a little space they sat in silence, like two
children venturing into some unknown region and
gaining courage by clasp of hands. At last he
rose.</p>

<p>“I will leave you now, dear heart. But it’s
not good-by, even yet. I still believe that sometime
I shall call you wife. I’m proud to have won
your love, Rhoda, prouder than of anything else
I shall ever do.”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand to his lips, bowed ceremoniously,
and a moment later she was listening
to the sound of his footsteps as he walked down
the path to the gate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p>After the discovery of the hiding place in the
woodshed, Dr. Ware and his Underground co-workers
thought it best for a little while to receive
no runaways in his house. For it was closely
watched, not only by the officers whose duty it
was to enforce the Fugitive Slave law, but also
by the slave hunters who made it a business to
trail and capture northward-bound chattels for the
sake of the rewards offered by their owners. In
order to divert suspicion Walter and Lewis Kimball
and several other young men who were in
the habit of keeping a lookout for the fugitives
contrived to secrete them elsewhere until surveillance
upon the white house on the hilltop was
relaxed.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dr. Ware made ready a new
place of concealment. An end of the cellar extending
beneath the room occupied by the two black
servants was separated from the rest by a solid
wall. A trap door was cut in the floor and a flight
of stairs set in. Carpet concealed the door and
over it was usually set a table, chairs, or other
furniture. The cellar room was dark and had
little ventilation, but Dr. Ware and Rhoda congratulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
themselves that it would be perfectly
safe.</p>

<p>“Why, father, it’s like a dungeon in a castle,”
the girl exclaimed with a laughing face as she
came up after making it ready with pallets and
cots and a generous supply of old quilts and
blankets. “While they are shut up in there they
can rest and sleep, and so can we, without the
least fear that they’ll be discovered!”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware cast an observant look at her alert
and smiling countenance. Not since the adventure
with the marshal had she seemed so like her usual
self. Following those self-absorbed days, when
she had seemed to be going about in a happy
dream, had come a period of depression. His professional
eye had noted that she did not eat as a
healthy young creature should and his fatherly
solicitude had made him quickly conscious of her
lessened vivacity of spirit. The changes in her
demeanor cost him a good deal of anxious thought—much
more, indeed, than she supposed he ever
bestowed upon her. He knew that Jefferson Delavan
had been there again, but Rhoda told him
nothing of what had passed between them. So
he merely guessed that his daughter had struggled
once more with her heart and had paid dearly for
the victory.</p>

<p>He watched her anxiously, but shrank from
speaking to her about her physical state because
he felt sure of its emotional cause and could foresee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the trend the conversation would take. For the
leading-strings of habit were strong upon them
both, and even stronger was the constraint of
self-consciousness in a middle-aged man who all
his life had cultivated the intellectual side of his
nature at the expense of the emotional. Only
toward the wife who had woven so strong a mesh
about his heart in the days when the blood of
young manhood was hot and winey and, in different
scope and color, toward the child who so much
resembled her, had he ever been able to express
in words and actions the inner warmth and tenderness
of his heart.</p>

<p>Of Rhoda he made a companion much more
than he did of either his wife or Charlotte. When
she settled down at home after the three years she
had spent, in her latter teens, at Dr. Scott’s Female
Institute, he had been much pleased to find that
he could talk with her seriously upon most subjects
that interested him. And since then they
had grown into a deep and wide intellectual understanding
and sympathy. But between them
there was no emotional expression of their mutual
feeling.</p>

<p>During this last year he had watched with pride
her rapid development in character and intellect.
Her Underground work had stimulated her sympathies
and trained her in self-reliance and her
increased interest in political affairs had broadened
and developed her intellectually until, from an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
attractive girl of rather more than average endowment
she had become a woman whose companionship
her father enjoyed upon an equal footing.
Blind babies, if the windows of sense perception
are not opened into their minds, become imbecile.
Perhaps—but everybody knows that argument by
analogy is the most deceptive of all the paths by
which human beings endeavor to find truth.</p>

<p>So, to go back to Rhoda and the new place of
concealment in the cellar. Dr. Ware was much
gratified to see her more lively demeanor that
morning and began to hope that, with the renewal
of their Underground operations and the constant
call they would make upon both heart and head,
she would soon forget the pain that had been benumbing
her energies. She told him she was going
to a meeting of the sewing circle that afternoon at
which they were to consider the question of enlarging
its sphere and turning it into an anti-slavery
society. He thought it a good idea and
encouraged her to do all she could toward that
end.</p>

<p>She went early to Mrs. Hardaker’s house, where
the meeting was to be held, and proved to be the
first arrival. Horace was there, not having yet
returned to his office after dinner, and as she
entered he greeted her with—</p>

<p>“Rhoda, here’s a grand thing! Just listen!”</p>

<p>She saw that he had the New York “Tribune”
in his hands, and as he began to read her attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
was at once absorbed by the bitter and mournful
eloquence of Horace Greeley’s lament over the
Dred Scott decision—a bit of literature that ought
to be among the classics of American journalism
and studied by every aspirant for its honors. But
it is buried too deep among the yellowing sheets
of forgotten newspaper files to be known, in these
busy days of a later generation, to any but an occasional
investigator. It had its own brief day
of vigorous life, when it stirred profoundly the
minds and hearts of tens upon tens of thousands
of earnest men and women. And then like a dead
leaf it fluttered down to earth, to become a part
of that debris of the centuries that makes a richer
soil for the growth of human souls.</p>

<p>With quickening pulse Rhoda listened to the
stately march of the sentences, as Hardaker’s
fluent, oratorical voice gave to each its full significance.
As he came to the closing lines his
listener’s breath was catching now and then and
her eyes and cheeks were aflame:</p>

<p>“The star of freedom and the stripes of bondage
are henceforth one. American republicanism
and American slavery are in the future to be
synonymous. This, then, is the final fruit. In
this all the labors of our statesmen, the blood of
our heroes, the lifelong cares and toils of our forefathers,
the aspirations of our scholars, the prayers
of good men, have finally ended. America the
slave breeder and slaveholder!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>As Hardaker looked up and saw her countenance
aglow with the fires of her soul it occurred
to him that, after all, Rhoda Ware was beautiful.
Like the tuned strings of a musical instrument her
emotional nature had responded to the touch upon
her convictions, and behind this mingled glow of
indignation and aspiring soul he felt all the forces
of her woman’s heart, her powers of loving, her
wealth of compassion and tenderness. As he left
the house he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“A girl like that—she ought to be a Joan of
Arc!” For the first time in his rather long and
somewhat spasmodic suit for her heart hope of
final success almost fell away from him. If such
a rare, fine creature mated at all, he felt rather
than put into definite thought, it surely ought to
be with some being of finer clay than the average
man. And then he jammed his hat down hard
and said to himself, definitely and savagely: “The
idea of her marrying a damned slaveholder!”
Horace Hardaker was a church member in good
standing, and it was only in the intimacy of his soul
and upon most infrequent occasions that he allowed
himself such lapses of speech. When he did it
was a sure sign that his indignation had a strong
personal tang.</p>

<p>The band of women in Mrs. Hardaker’s parlor
talked while they sewed, discussing the proposition
of turning themselves into a more ambitious
society. Some were averse, saying they already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
did as much as they could and that, moreover, to
venture outside the sphere of their homes and
attempt to do things that men could do better
would not be a proper and becoming course.
Rhoda, stitching busily, now and then put in an
argument or answered an objection. Her ardor,
pleasant demeanor, and practical capacity had
made her a favorite with all the members of the
society, old and young. Her unfortunate love
affair, of which all of them knew something, invested
her with a romantic interest and set her a
little apart, because of her opportunity and her
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Of a sudden Rhoda felt her heart swell with
the desire for utterance. She began speaking, at
first with her needle still busy. But, after the first
two or three sentences, her work dropped from
her hands and she leaned forward, her face glowing,
as she dwelt upon the discouragement which
had fallen upon all who hoped for either the ending
or the staying of the progress of slavery, and
of the greater need than ever before that every
one who believed slavery to be an evil should work
against it with zeal. She spoke quietly and simply,
with the intense and moving earnestness of a strong
personality in the grip of a passionate conviction.
One after another the women dropped their needles
and listened with rapt attention. For a few minutes
she talked and then she caught up the paper
and read the article in the “Tribune.” At its close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
the utter silence of the room was broken only by
a half-suppressed sob here and there. After a
moment she said modestly:</p>

<p>“Well, friends, what are we going to do about
this matter?”</p>

<p>A woman in the back of the room began clapping
her hands softly, and presently Rhoda was
shrinking back, blushing and abashed, before the
storm of applause. Immediately and enthusiastically,
and perhaps not in strict accord with parliamentary
rules, it was decided to change their
circle into a “Female Anti-Slavery Society,” to
continue their present work and to add to it
whatever their hands might find to do, and to make
Rhoda Ware its president. Surprised and embarrassed,
she tried to decline the honor. But the
women, crowding around her with praise and
caresses, would not let her refuse.</p>

<p>At home she said nothing of the affair to her
mother or sister, to neither of whom did she ever
make mention of any of her anti-slavery activities.
All that portion of her life, which, indeed, had
come to be the major part, had as little community
with them as if there had been between them no
bond of love and use and relationship. To her
father she related the bare facts of the occasion.
But he soon heard from Horace Hardaker, whose
mother had told him all about it, a full and enthusiastic
account of what had taken place.</p>

<p>Rhoda grieved much over the growing alienation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
between herself and her mother and sister.
Charlotte held herself plainly aloof, and Rhoda
was puzzled by an evident resentment in her attitude.
She did not know that Charlotte held her
responsible for her own failure to capture the
fancy of Jefferson Delavan.</p>

<p>“She’s no right to keep him dangling after her
if she doesn’t intend to marry him,” was the vexed
young woman’s summing up of the situation, having
quite decided that if her sister would only move
out of the way she herself would soon be mistress
of Fairmount.</p>

<p>As the spring and summer went by Mrs. Ware’s
hope for a marriage between Jeff and Rhoda
dwindled into profound disappointment. A sadness
came into her face and voice that smote her
daughter to the heart. The sick-headaches, to
which she had long been subject, became more frequent,
and other ailments began to manifest themselves.
Fearing remorsefully that her anti-slavery
work and her refusal to marry Delavan were at
the bottom of her mother’s failing health, the girl
strove in all tender, care-taking ways of which
she could think to make amends for the double
hurt and disappointment. In the conduct of the
house Mrs. Ware leaned upon her more than ever.
But as the months wore on Rhoda felt keenly that
the old tenderness and intimacy between them were
disappearing.</p>

<p>The warm weather brought much increase of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
Underground traffic. At that time and during the
years immediately following the work of the Road
was at its height. For its operations there were
friends, money, workers in plenty, and slaves
were gathered up even before they reached the
free-state border, and hurried on from hand to
hand in such secrecy and safety that they had
hardly a care or a responsibility until they found
themselves secure on British soil.</p>

<p>To Rhoda her father gave over most of the
care of the fugitives upon their arrival and while
they were secreted in the cellar. Not infrequently
also she drove them on to the next station, sometimes
in the night, sometimes by day, in a spring
wagon with a false bottom which he had bought
for this purpose. Occasionally Chad Wallace appeared
in the neighborhood with his peddler’s
wagon at their service, if it did not already contain
its complement of hidden chattels. Now and then
farmer Gilbertson, on a trip to town, hauled back
some “baggage” well concealed in his wagon bed,
to be stowed away in his hollow haystack until it
could be sent on to the next station. A man who
had a market garden out on the same road and
drove back and forth a good deal with vegetables
for the Hillside market and for steamboat supplies,
and another who traveled about ostensibly selling
reeds often carried black passengers.</p>

<p>With hands and head and heart all so full
Rhoda found little time to spend in thinking of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
own unhappiness. Nevertheless, the day never
went by that had not a little space saved out from
other things and held apart for thought of her
lover. Now and then a letter passed between them.
But from these missives was dropped all mention
of both slavery and love, although on both sides
the correspondence breathed a sense of mutual
tenderness and understanding that amounted to a
sort of spiritual intimacy. To Rhoda these letters
were the treasure of her heart. They were read
over and over again, held caressingly in her hands
during the brief minutes of each day when she
gave herself up to thought of him, and kept under
her pillow or upon her breast while she slept. Every
night, when she knelt at her bedside, her petitions
to the Heavenly Father begged for His
blessing upon her efforts in behalf of the slaves,
pleaded that He would soon put forth His hand
and make an end of slavery, and implored the
safety and the happiness of her lover.</p>

<p>In the late summer there came a message from
Fairmount. Emily Delavan, Mrs. Ware’s namesake,
was to be married in October and the Ware
family was bidden to the festivities. The news
set Charlotte upon the borders of ecstatic delight.
The visit, which was to be prolonged through several
weeks, would not only be filled with no end of
alluring pleasures and amusements, but it should
open, she decided at once, the door of escape from
her home into more congenial surroundings. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
would be just the sort of environment,—a gay
crowd of people with nothing to do but enjoy themselves—in
which she knew she always appeared to
best advantage. Two or three uninterrupted weeks
of it, with Jefferson Delavan always there to feel
the effects of her charms, and she could be quite
sure of the result. But—there was Rhoda.</p>

<p>“If she’s there,” Charlotte grumbled to herself,
“she’ll just keep on making Jeff think she’s going
to marry him some day, and have him dangling
after her all the time.”</p>

<p>Why should Rhoda want to go at all, if she
really meant to play fair with Jeff? The girl soon
came to the conclusion, with which she promptly
acquainted her sister, that the other ought not to
attend the wedding.</p>

<p>“It will be very unkind to me if you insist on
going, Rhoda,” she complained. “It will spoil
all my pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Sister! Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“Because you’ll keep Jeff hanging around you
all the time, just as he does when he’s here. Somehow
you manage to make him think that you’re
going to marry him sometime when you know you
don’t intend to at all. It isn’t fair to me, Rhoda,
you know it isn’t.”</p>

<p>Rhoda had already begun to plan ways and
means by which her duties and responsibilities
could be cared for during her absence, for she
wished much to make the visit. Her youthful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
spirit, so much neglected and denied of late, was
asserting itself once more and eagerly anticipating
the new experience and the promised social gaieties.
But above all she wished to go in order that
she might be with her lover in his own home, and
afterward be able to picture his daily life more
vividly in her thought.</p>

<p>“You’re not being fair to me now, Charlotte,”
she replied. “I’ve told Jeff over and over that I
can’t marry him. And I’m sure I don’t want to
hinder him from marrying any one else, if he
wants to.”</p>

<p>“Then be as good as your word, Rhoda, and
stay away from where he is. He’s attentive enough
to me when you’re not around, and if you’ll just
give me a fair chance—you’ll see—I’ll come back
engaged!”</p>

<p>Rhoda threw up her head and answered, with
a calm intensity in her tone that made Charlotte
look at her curiously: “Very well. I’ll stay at
home. I’ve no claim on Jeff, and you can do whatever
you like.”</p>

<p>Charlotte flew across the room, threw her arms
around Rhoda’s neck, kissed her and declared she
was a “dear old thing.” And Rhoda, warming
in response and comforted a little for her own
hurt, smiled with pleasure at this outburst of
affection, returned her caresses and called her
“silly little sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“You can be an old maid if you want to and
spend your life working for niggers,” Charlotte
exclaimed, dancing about the room, “but I mean to
have a good time and make the niggers work for
me!” She stopped suddenly and with head on one
side regarded Rhoda anxiously. “Will you promise,”
she broke out, “that you won’t tell mother
why you don’t go?”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t tell her!”</p>

<p>“Nor anybody else?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Good sister! Then I’ll love you more than
ever!”</p>

<p>When Rhoda declared, and her mother could
not induce her to change her decision, that it would
be impossible for her to go, the disappointment
was so keen that it sent Mrs. Ware to bed with
one of her severest headaches. Rhoda cared for
her with all tenderness, and, in secret bitterness
and tears that her mother must now think more
hardly of her than she deserved, wished that Charlotte
would offer to give back her promise. But
she would not ask it of her sister, and to that
young woman, in the height of girlish spirits, busy
with the dressmaker and her own plans, there
never occurred the faintest idea of making the
offer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ware knew, even before she tried, that she
could not induce her husband to accept the hospitality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
of a slave owner, and so, finally, it was
only herself and her younger daughter who made
the journey. As they were saying good-by Charlotte
whispered to her sister:</p>

<p>“This time next year, Rhoda, I’ll be inviting
you to Fairmount!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p>Letters from Mrs. Ware and Charlotte told of
much gaiety and of days that were an unceasing
round of enjoyment. Charlotte wrote that it was
“heaven upon earth” and that never before had
she “even imagined how happy a girl could be.”
But in her mother’s letters Rhoda detected a note
of melancholy. Although at one with the life
around her in memory, training, sympathy and belief,
she yet seemed to feel herself an alien while
in the midst of it and to be saddened by her own
lack of complete accord.</p>

<p>“Poor mother!” thought Rhoda. “She loves
father and me so much that she can’t help feeling
loyal to us with a part of her heart. Dear, dear
mother!”</p>

<p>Moreover, Mrs. Ware was not well, and declared
she would be glad to return home. She
related briefly that Jeff and Emily had divided the
estate, two thirds of which, according to their
father’s will, belonged to the brother. Emily had
chosen some land and a number of slaves and, as
her husband already has as many negroes as he
needed, it was their intention to realize upon these
at once and put the money into improvements upon
his estate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“They’ll be sold ‘down south,’ I suppose,” said
Rhoda, as she read the letter aloud to her father.</p>

<p>“Very likely. Those big cotton, cane and rice
plantations are an insatiable market for slaves.
They can’t get enough labor. That is why the
South is so anxious to reopen the African slave
trade. It’s an open secret, which the North winks
at, as it does at everything the South chooses to
do, that the traffic is already going on. Since the
Dred Scott decision there is nothing they stop at.
It’s a pity Chad Wallace or Alexander Wilson
isn’t in the neighborhood of Fairmount just now.
If they were, Emily’s husband wouldn’t be able to
make so many improvements!”</p>

<p>A few days later Dr. Ware called Rhoda into
his office, anxiety in his demeanor. “I’ve just received
this letter from Wilson,” he exclaimed,
“written in Louisville. See what he says:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Ware</span>: Am sending you to-day
by express one blackbird, a fine specimen,
securely boxed. I was fortunate enough to secure
a live one, as I knew you would find the specimen
more interesting alive than dead.’”</p>

<p>“Father!” cried Rhoda, her eyes wide and horrified.
“He’s sent some one in a box! All the
way from Louisville! Oh, we must see about it
at once!”</p>

<p>“The letter was evidently written in great haste,”
Dr. Ware continued, “on a dirty scrap of paper
and,—yes, it was mailed on the boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“Then the box came on the steamboat with the
letter!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and will be at the express office now. Jim
must take the spring wagon and go after it.”</p>

<p>Rhoda waited in extreme anxiety for Jim’s return,
fearful lest the poor creature should be dead
in the box. Even Dr. Ware showed a lessening
of his usual calm. They said little to each other
during the man’s absence, but together made ready
everything that might be necessary if the “blackbird”
should be unconscious. They knew of more
than one daring escape from slavery by similar
methods. And they knew too of the recent release
from a southern penitentiary, after an eight years’
term, of a man who had been convicted of attempting
to rescue a slave by this same means.</p>

<p>The box, short and narrow and looking hardly
large enough to contain a human being, was hurried
into Jim’s room and the cover quickly removed.
Within was the huddled figure of a woman, her
knees drawn up to her chin, and all her body held
in the close confines as tightly as in a vise. She did
not move and when they spoke to her there was
no answer.</p>

<p>“No, she’s not dead,” said Dr. Ware, his finger
on her pulse. They lifted her out and restorative
measures soon brought her back to consciousness.
But she was ghastly pale and trembling from head
to foot.</p>

<p>“You poor thing! You’re safe now,” Rhoda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
soothed, patting her arm, as she began to sob
hysterically. “We are your friends and we’ll take
care of you.”</p>

<p>She was young and comely, perhaps one-fourth
colored, with neither complexion nor features
showing more than a faint trace of her negro heritage.
Presently they were able to give her food
and water, and a little later she told them her
story. As she talked Rhoda sat beside her, clasping
her hand and now and then patting her arm in
sympathy and encouragement. Her speech was
simple, but good, showing intelligence and some
training.</p>

<p>“How did Mr. Wilson happen to send you in
a box?” asked Dr. Ware.</p>

<p>“It was the only way. They had to get rid of
me quick. I’d been sold to a trader from New
Orleans and he’d brought me and a lot of others
to Louisville to take us on the steamboat. I knew
he’d paid a big price for me, and from that and
the way he talked me over I knew what he’d
bought me for. I made up my mind I’d rather
die, or do anything. A chance happened to come,
on the street in Louisville, as he was taking us to
the boat, and in a crowd I give him the slip.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what I’d do or where I’d go,
but I just hurried along down another street, and
then I saw the man who’d been at master’s plantation
last year and told us about going to Canada
if we wanted to try it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Yes—Mr. Wilson,” Dr. Ware interrupted.</p>

<p>“I knew him right away, though he looked different,
and I spoke to him and told him what I
wanted. He said to follow him and we walked
fast and turned up and down streets, and came to
a free woman’s house. But they’d followed us,
and in two or three minutes they were at the door.
The woman took me into the back room and told
me to jump into that box. Then she put the cover
down quick and went back and I heard the men
go all round the house looking for me and they
swore at the woman and told her they’d seen me
come in and they’d watch the house and keep on
searching it till they got me. Then the man—Mr.
Wilson, you said?—spoke up right loud and
said he couldn’t wait any longer and would she
have his clothes ready if he’d send for the box
right away, ’cause he wanted to catch the boat
for Cincinnati. I ’spected he meant me, and he
did. She put a pillow in the box and some biscuits
and a bottle of water, and cut a little hole in the
side, so I could breathe.</p>

<p>“I thought I was gwine die in the box,” the
woman went on, again showing signs of hysteria,
as memory of her experience returned. “It was
such a little box I had to be all crunched up and I
got awful pains, and sometimes it seemed as if I’d
just have to scream right out. And then I’d think
what would happen if I did, and I’d be caught and
they’d flog me and send me—where they’d bought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
me for, and then I’d bite hard on the pillow and
keep still. And once the box was turned up so I
was on my head till I knew I was gwine die in
another minute, but they turned it down again and
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>She stopped speaking, as long, nervous sobs
shook her frame. The tears were streaming down
Rhoda’s face and her bosom was heaving as with
trembling hands she administered the draught her
father had prepared. Dr. Ware noted her agitation
and admonished her gently to calm herself.
The old fear of displeasing him by showing too
much emotion quickly steadied her nerves. To
distract her thoughts from the fugitive’s harrowing
experience he began to question the woman,
as she grew quiet once more, about her life in
slavery.</p>

<p>“You must have had a hard master to be
willing to take such chances to gain your freedom.”</p>

<p>“It was the trader I run away from, ’cause I
knew what he’d bought me for. Master was a
kind man.”</p>

<p>“But he sold you.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t master that sold us. He never does.
It was Miss Emily, ’cause she married.”</p>

<p>A chill struck to Rhoda’s heart. Was her fate
to be forever linked in this way with that of the
slaves from Fairmount? She was glad her father
did not even look at her as he passed, with apparent
unconcern, to the logical next question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Who was your master?”</p>

<p>“Jefferson Delavan, of Fairmount, just beyond
Lexington. He was a kind man and never sold
any of the slaves. His mother, old mistress, was
kind too, when she was alive, and she took pains
with some of us. She was teaching me to be her
maid. But Miss Emily’s different. She’s sold
nearly all of us that fell to her share.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware stole an anxious glance at Rhoda.
She was sitting at the bedside, with the woman’s
hand clasped in hers, her eyes straight in front,
her lips pressed together and her face stern.</p>

<p>“It’s hardly fair to make the blame personal,”
he ventured. She flashed up at him indignant
eyes and her voice was bitter with scorn as she
replied:</p>

<p>“But he allowed her to be sold, father, and for
such a purpose!”</p>

<p>He hesitated, considering a temptation. In his
daughter’s present mood it would be easy to deepen
this impulse of condemnation and so perhaps undermine
her love for Delavan. But the next instant
he told himself that it would not be fair.
“The man has enough to answer for—let him at
least have justice,” was his thought.</p>

<p>Rhoda felt his calm eyes upon her, but she
would not meet them. “You must remember,”
he was saying judicially, “that no man can be better
than the system of which he is a part. It is
quite possible that Delavan knew nothing of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
this, except that his sister chose certain slaves as
her share. I don’t know very much about him,
but I think he’s decent enough to have protested
if he had known of this woman’s fate. I also
think it’s most unlikely it would have done any
good if he had. And there it is, Rhoda! No
matter how well-intentioned an individual slaveholder
may be, he is likely to be swept along any
minute by his system into its worst abominations.
Our indictment must always be against the system,
not against individuals.”</p>

<p>When Rhoda knelt at her bedside that night
the look of scorn had faded from her countenance
and in its place were tears. “Dear Father in
Heaven,” she prayed, “do not let Thy punishment
fall upon him. He knows not what he does. His
eyes are so blinded that he cannot see how evil
these things are. Do not punish him, do not let
Thy vengeance fall upon him, until his eyes are
opened and he sees that they are evil. And grant,
O God, I beg of Thee, grant me this, that I may
make amends to this poor creature for his wrong.
If Thy vengeance is ripe and can be stayed no
longer, let it fall upon my head. Let me bear
his punishment. But grant me first that I may
save her.”</p>

<p>The fugitive, whose name, Lear White, it was
decided should be changed to Mary Ellen Dunstable,
had been so unnerved by her sufferings that
for several days she sorely needed Rhoda’s care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
and Dr. Ware’s medical attention. Rhoda would
not permit her to go into the cellar hiding place,
but made a bed for her in her own room and
watched over her with every solicitude. A dust
of powder over her light-colored face was enough
to give her the appearance of a white girl of
brunette complexion. Only a close observer would
be likely to note that the whites of her eyes and
the form of her nose gave a hint of negro origin.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Rhoda, when the girl had been
two days in the house, “I can’t bear to think of
sending Mary Ellen on in the usual way. She took
such awful chances to escape from a horrible fate,
and she came so near to death in that box, that it
seems to me almost as if God had put her into my
charge, and meant for me to make up to her for
all that she has suffered. I feel as if I ought not
to let her out of my hands until she is safe in
Canada.”</p>

<p>“Well, what have you thought of doing? Have
you a plan?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mary Ellen looks so much like a white
woman that I’m sure she and I could travel together,
as two girl friends, and go to Cleveland
by the canal. There I can put her on one of our
friendly boats and the captain will take charge
of her till she is safe on the ferry at Detroit.”</p>

<p>They talked the matter over at length, Rhoda
dwelling upon the girl’s nervous condition, which
had so lessened her self-reliance and her courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
as to make doubtful the wisdom of sending her on
alone by the ordinary methods. But another reason
of equal strength in her own mind, although
she did not mention it to her father, was her
conviction that here was an opportunity to make
atonement for what she felt to be her lover’s sin.
Moreover, the girl clung to her with such implicit
confidence in her power to shield and save that
Rhoda’s heart rose high with a passion of resoluteness,
like a mother’s for her threatened offspring.</p>

<p>It was finally decided that her plan should be
carried out. The Female Anti-Slavery Society
offered its little store of cash—pitifully small since
the money panic of two months previous—to help
defray Mary Ellen’s expenses. Several of the
members donated material they had bought for
their own winter wardrobes and helped Rhoda
make it up into gowns for the fugitive.</p>

<p>On her way downtown one day Rhoda saw a
new handbill on the trunk of a tree at the crossing
of the two main streets. It was of a sort that
had been familiar to her since her childhood. At
one side was a crude woodcut of a negro on the
run, a bundle on the end of a stick across his
shoulder. She stopped to read it, wondering if it
concerned any of the blacks who had been sheltered
under their roof. It offered three hundred
dollars reward, told of the running away of “my
negro girl, Lear White,” gave a detailed and accurate
description of her, saying she was “light-colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
and good-looking,” and was signed, “William
H. Burns,” with his address in Louisville.
Rhoda walked on, smiling, thinking in what a
little while that poster would be of no consequence
whatever to Lear White, for they were to start
the next morning.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Marcia Kimball came, to help
Rhoda with the final preparations. They tried
upon Mary Ellen the gown, in which they had
just set the last stitches, that she was to wear on
the journey. Much pleased with its effect, Marcia
whitened her face with a fresh dusting of powder,
and she stood before them a handsome brunette
with a pale complexion, big, soft, black eyes and
coal-black, waving hair. Marcia clapped her
hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Splendid, Rhoda! Nobody would ever guess!
Oh, you’ll get through all right!”</p>

<p>Rhoda, standing beside the window, glanced out
and her face grew grave. “Come here a minute,
Marcia,” she said. Some men were entering at
the side gate. Miss Kimball paled. “Marshal
Hanscomb!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t believe they suspect that she’s
here. There are three men in the cellar, that Mr.
Gilbertson is going to stop for this evening. We
must put on a bold front. Don’t let Mary Ellen
know—she’d be scared to death, and they might
guess. Come,” she exclaimed in a louder voice,
turning gaily from the window, “let’s go downstairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
and have some music. Marcia, you ought
to hear Mary Ellen sing ‘Nellie Gray’! Come
down and you and she sing it together, and I’ll
play!”</p>

<p>Laughing and talking, with every appearance
of gaiety, though the hearts of two of them were
beating fast, the three went down to the living-room
and took their places at the piano. With
ears strained to catch the sounds from the other
parts of the house, Rhoda struck the opening
notes and the two voices sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“There’s a low green valley on the old Kentucky shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Where I’ve whiled many happy hours away,</div>
<div class="verse">A-sitting and a-singing by the little cottage door</div>
<div class="verse">Where lived my darling Nellie Gray.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Rhoda stopped for a moment and heard the
tramp of the men as they came up the stairs from
the cellar. Then she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Why, Marcia, you’re singing all out of tune!
I never heard you do that before. Come, now,
let’s all sing the chorus together!”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen’s voice rose, rich and melodious,
above the other two as the music made its mournful
plaint through the simple lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“Oh, my poor Nellie Gray,</div>
<div class="verse">They have taken her away,</div>
<div class="verse">And I’ll never see my darling any more!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The men were going through the rooms upstairs
and one of them said to another, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
stopped to listen, “That girl can sing, can’t she?”</p>

<p>Rhoda heard them coming downstairs and
knew that Marcia was looking at her with eyes
wide and face a little pale. Would they come in?
Suddenly she was aware that her nerves were
steady and strong as steel and that her heart was
beating as calmly as ever. “Now for the next
verse, Marcia!” and her fingers moved across the
keys. Then she heard the men at the door.</p>

<p>“There’s some one in the hall. I must see what
they want,” she said, rising and casting an encouraging
smile at Miss Kimball. Marcia gazed
at her wonderingly as she moved calmly across
the room and then, feeling the contagion of her
courage, turned quickly to Mary Ellen, and to
draw her attention away from the door so that she
would not face it, began asking her what other
songs she knew.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Ware, for disturbing you and
your friends,” Marshal Hanscomb was saying,
“but my duties under the law make it necessary for
me to search your house.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Hanscomb. Come in if you
wish to. Miss Kimball is here—I think you know
her—and the other lady is my friend, Miss Dunstable,
from Cincinnati, who has been visiting me
for the last week.”</p>

<p>The marshal stepped inside, his assistants close
behind him. Rhoda cast a single glance toward
the piano and saw thankfully that Marcia was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
holding Mary Ellen’s attention. “If only she
won’t look around,” was her anxious thought.
Then turning to the marshal she said seriously,
with a gentle smile:</p>

<p>“You see, there’s no one else visible in here,
Mr. Hanscomb, but if you want to look under
the piano and up the chimney—” she stopped on
a rising inflection and looked at him gravely. His
eyes flashed, but he merely sent an inquiring glance
around the room, saw that there were no closets
or recesses, and then moved toward the door, saying,
“Thank you, Miss Ware.”</p>

<p>Rhoda closed the door behind him and leaned
against it while she drew a long breath and pressed
her lips together tightly for a moment. Then
she went back to the piano saying, “Now, Marcia,
suppose we let Mary Ellen sing that next verse all
alone. I want you to hear her.”</p>

<p>The men on the veranda steps, taking their
departure, paused and listened to the closing lines
as Mary Ellen, in a voice of mournful sweetness,
sang on alone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“They have taken her to Georgia,</div>
<div class="verse">For to wear her life away,</div>
<div class="verse">As she toils in the cotton and the cane.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“That girl makes a right good imitation of the
way a darkey’s voice sounds,” said the one who
had spoken before. “I reckon she’s practised it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p>Rhoda’s heart was high with expectation of
success when she and Mary Ellen started upon the
journey to Cleveland. The runaway, in her new
gown and a bonnet and veil, played her part perfectly,
and Rhoda told her father that he might
expect her back in a few days with the news that
all had gone well. “And I,” she added to herself,
“shall then be able to feel that I have paid off
Jeff’s debt of wrongdoing to this poor girl.”</p>

<p>As they were going on board the steamboat Jim
came hurrying down to the landing from the post-office
with the morning mail, which contained a
letter for Rhoda. She saw that it was from Charlotte,
and put it unopened into her pocket to read
later. For, notwithstanding her inward assurance
that her adventure could not fail, she felt anxious
about the short time they would have to remain
on the river boat. Slave traders and their agents
and slave catchers were constantly journeying up
and down the river, and if one of these who had
appraised Mary Ellen in her days of bondage
should happen to see her he might recognize her
as Lear White. She kept her charge engaged in
conversation, the better to carry out the pretense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
that they were two ladies traveling together, and
warned her not to raise her veil.</p>

<p>The transfer to the canal boat safely made,
Rhoda felt much less anxious and relaxed a little
of her care. They sat upon the deck, and Mary
Ellen lifted her veil now and then, the better to
see the succession of charming views through which
they passed. The wooded hills were ablaze with
autumn foliage and these alternated with open
lands where fields of brown stubble, acres of
ripened corn, pasturing cattle and busy farm yards
told of autumn’s rewards for the year’s labor.
Mary Ellen was much interested in all this and had
many questions to ask as to how the work was
done and whether or not it would be the same in
Canada. Several hours passed in this way before
Rhoda bethought her again of the letter from
Charlotte. Smiling at thought of the enthusiastic
account it would contain of the round of pleasures
since her last missive, she took it from her pocket
and drew a little apart, while Mary Ellen became
engrossed in looking at a town which they were
approaching. A number of people were at the
landing and she gazed at them, the tree-shaded
streets, the buildings and the church spires with
the self-forgetfulness of a child amid new surroundings.</p>

<p>Instead of the long letter she expected Rhoda
found in the envelope a single sheet and dashed
across the middle of it the one sentence, “I told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
you I’d soon be engaged, and I am! Charlotte.”</p>

<p>The words danced and blurred before her eyes
as she stared at them, all her attention indrawn
to the pain in her breast. This, then, was all love
meant to a man—the whim of a moment or a
month, ready to be captured by the first pretty
girl who made the effort. Had it not been the
same with Horace Hardaker? Why should she
have expected Jeff’s love to be of any more substantial
fiber? And, moreover, what right had she
to expect or wish him to be faithful to her? But
her quivering heart cried out that if he had loved
as she did he would have been faithful, even unto
death. And down in the bottom of her soul she
knew that her pain was not all for his lost love,
that some of it, much of it, was for her ideal of his
love and faith and chivalrous heart, stabbed to
death by this immediate surrender to Charlotte’s
allurements.</p>

<p>“Miss Rhoda! Miss Rhoda! Miss Rhoda!”</p>

<p>The frightened cry, repeated over and over,
seeming at first to come out of some far-off space,
pierced her indrawn consciousness. She looked
up in a dazed way, her thoughts stumbling back
slowly to her surroundings. Then she saw that
Mary Ellen, between two men, was being hustled
off the boat.</p>

<p>She sprang after them and seized the arm of
one of the men. “What are you doing?” she demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“You’ll soon find out what you’ve been doing!”
the man replied.</p>

<p>“This is an outrage!” Rhoda exclaimed. “Let
this woman go, or I shall have you arrested! She
is Miss Dunstable of Cincinnati, and is traveling
with me. Let her go, I say!”</p>

<p>The man laughed and pushed on. “No, she
ain’t. She’s Lear White and she’s a slave and
belongs to William H. Burns. I’m his agent and
I was with him when he bought her and helped to
take her and the rest of his gang to Louisville,
where she give him the slip. I come up through
this black abolition country to watch for her, and
I knew her the minute I set eyes on her, though
you have got her fixed up so fine.”</p>

<p>With one sweep of his handkerchief across her
cheek, he exposed a broad stripe of browner skin.
He laughed contemptuously, and a number of
others who had gathered round them on the landing
laughed also. Rhoda heard the epithet,
“nigger-thief,” in derisive tones passed from one
to another. She knew well that if the crowd’s
sympathies were with him there was no telling
what it might do. Gripping his arm with both
hands and bracing herself against his effort to
move on, she faced about, head high and eyes
flashing, and cried:</p>

<p>“Is there no one here who will help me to save
this poor girl?”</p>

<p>Then she was aware that from the back of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
concourse some men were pushing their way toward
her. She struggled against the efforts of Mary
Ellen’s captors to go on and would not release
her hold of the one next her, thinking that here
might be deliverance, or, at least, help. As they
came nearer she saw that one was in Quaker garb,
and her hopes rose. In the matter of a runaway
slave there was no doubting on which side would
be the active sympathy and assistance of a Friend.
In response to his inquiry she told him her own
and her father’s name.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said heartily, “I’ve heard of
Dr. Ware.” He glanced at Mary Ellen, dumb and
patient between her captors, then back at Rhoda,
and understanding flashed between their eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “Thee’ll soon find
friends here, who’ll do their best to bring things
out all right for thee and for her too.”</p>

<p>They moved on, the mob around them rapidly
increasing. By the looks of the men and the
remarks which reached her ears she knew that it
was, for the most part, pro-slavery in feeling. The
Quaker was walking beside her, but his companions
had disappeared. Presently he whispered:</p>

<p>“The marshal will be here soon. Perhaps thee
could slip away and hide. There’ll be help if thee
wants to try it.”</p>

<p>Rhoda shook her head and whispered back:
“No, no. I mustn’t leave her.”</p>

<p>In a whisper so low it barely reached her ears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
she heard him say: “Never mind her. She’ll be
looked after.”</p>

<p>But before Rhoda could reply three men, pushing
their way authoritatively, were beside them,
and a moment later she found herself under arrest
and being marched along between the marshal’s
two assistants.</p>

<p>Soon she saw that a change was taking place in
the character of the crowd. Its numbers were
being rapidly augmented, but most of those who
were joining it now were silent, and Rhoda guessed
by their looks and by the glint of an eye here and
there that they were moved by a determined purpose.
The marshal surveyed them anxiously, spoke
to his aids, and they, with Rhoda between them,
held back, then edged their way into a cross street
and let the throng surge on past them. Then they
rushed her along until they came to a two-story
brick building, where they gave her into the charge
of another official, who locked her into an upstairs
room.</p>

<p>Through the barred windows she could see the
mob, now at a standstill half a block down the
street, eddying round the center where stood Mary
Ellen between her two captors, a drooping figure
of despair and resignation. On the outskirts and
apparently merely looking on was the Quaker,
who had told her his name was Daniel Benedict.
And still farther away her eye caught sight of a
familiar form, old and shabby, topped by a bell-crowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
hat, standing beside a dingy peddler’s
wagon and watching the proceedings with an interest
which broke out now and then in shrill calls
and shuffling capers.</p>

<p>Rhoda leaned against the bars, her hands wrung
together, and waited breathlessly for what might
happen next. The men were surging and pushing
this way and that, and she soon made out a resolute
movement on the part of those who were on the
outside to force their way to the center. Many
of those who made up the nucleus had been moved
apparently by idle curiosity, and they were now
falling back, out of the way of the onward efforts
of the others.</p>

<p>“There’s the marshal,” Rhoda exclaimed to
herself, pressing her face against the bars, “right
in front of Mary Ellen! Oh, poor, poor girl!
Surely, God won’t let them take her back! Those
men are pushing up closer! What’s the marshal
saying? Oh, he’s calling for a posse! There,
they’re fighting! Oh, see, they’ve got hold of
him!”</p>

<p>In her excitement she was breaking into speech.
“Oh, oh! They’ve knocked down the trader!—and
the other man—Mary Ellen—they’ve got her!
They’ve got her! And they’re shooting! Oh,
again! Again!”</p>

<p>Hands clasped hard against her heart, she stood
breathless, silent, watching the struggle, while the
sound of shots, the cries of the mob, and the shouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
of the officers broke the stillness of the room.
“There, they are getting her out! Oh, don’t hurt
her! Now—oh, run, Mary Ellen, run, run! Oh,
they’re helping her—two men—and another running
ahead— Oh, God, help her, help her to
safety!”</p>

<p>She leaned against the side of the window, sight
swimming and lips trembling, as Mary Ellen and
her body-guard of rescuers, dashing down another
street, passed from her view. Then she turned
her attention back to the throng of men who
seemed now to be intricately struggling with one
another. But presently the mass began to resolve
itself. A number, which seemed to contain both
parties, for some were evidently trying to stop
or hinder the others, rushed after the slave girl
and her protectors. Many others fell back and
stood near to be on hand for the next development.
They had not long to wait, for the marshal and
his assistants, regaining their feet, speedily began
arresting their assailants. Rhoda presently saw
them marching up to the jail door with a dozen
men under guard, of whom several were wounded.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she heard a tenor voice,
surprisingly good though somewhat cracked with
age, singing loudly in the street, “In Dixie land
I’ll take my stand.” She smiled, for she knew
the voice at once, and hurried back to the window.
Chad Wallace in his dingy peddler’s wagon was
passing the jail. His eyes were roving carelessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
over the front of the building and she felt sure
he saw her, although he made no sign. But he
flourished his whip in a wide circle round his head
and held it poised for a moment above his shoulder,
pointing back into the middle of his wagon.</p>

<p>Later in the day Daniel Benedict came to see
her and gave her explanation of what had happened.
His wrinkled, benignant face and silver
gray hair seemed to her distraught heart to carry
assurance of fatherly protection.</p>

<p>“Thy friend is safe now,” he told her, “and
not much the worse for her experience.”</p>

<p>“I saw from that window,” she exclaimed, “the
way they got her out of the crowd. It was wonderful—just
pushing a way for her and handing
her on from one to another and protecting her with
their bodies!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the Quaker, calmly, “it was
good work, and quickly done—else, they would
not have succeeded. I could take no part in it, for,
as thee doubtless knows, it is against my principles
to offer violent resistance to the law. But,”
he hesitated a moment and Rhoda saw a twinkle
flicker across his kindly eyes, “I do not feel that
it is necessary to hinder those who think differently.
There is a pretty strong anti-slavery sentiment
here, although there is plenty for the other side
too, and we determined some time ago that not
another seeker after freedom should ever be sent
back to his chains from this place. Those who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
no scruples against violent resistance were to be
free to do whatever they might think best and, for
the rest of us,”—and his eyes twinkled again,—“there
would not be lacking work for us, either.”</p>

<p>“But Mary Ellen? How did the trader get hold
of her? Do you know how it happened? I had
been so watchful, and had let her raise her veil
only now and then, when it seemed safe. I had not
left her side since we started, until just before
the awful thing happened. Then I heard her
call and they were dragging her off the boat. I
was hardly three feet away and had had my hand
off her arm, oh, it seemed hardly a minute! Have
you talked with her? Has she told you?”</p>

<p>He nodded gravely and the suggestion of a
smile appeared about his lips. Rhoda guessed
that Mary Ellen was hidden in his house. “Yes,
I have talked with the fugitive. She was leaning
on the rail, so interested in looking at the town
and at the landing as the boat came up that she
forgot about her veil. Then, among the people
on shore she recognized the trader and was so
frightened that she seemed to lose the power of
motion. He saw her the same instant, rushed upon
the boat and seized her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the fault is all mine!” moaned Rhoda.
“I should not have left her, I should not have taken
my eyes off her, for one single minute! I was too
proud, Mr. Benedict, and this is my punishment.
For I thought nobody but me could get her safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
to Cleveland and I had been so successful with
others—and with her too—that I thought I
couldn’t fail!”</p>

<p>“Well, she is safe again. But thee is likely to
suffer sadly for thy one moment of forgetfulness.”</p>

<p>She told him Mary Ellen’s story, dwelling especially
upon her sufferings during her long hours
in the box. When she ended he brought his fist
down on his knee and exclaimed solemnly:</p>

<p>“She has earned her freedom twenty times over
and she shall have it—fugitive slave law, constitution,
marshals, or presidents notwithstanding,
even if—if—Daniel Benedict has to forget his
principles for once!”</p>

<p>The next day he came again to see her, bringing
with him his wife, a little woman in Quaker bonnet
and gown, with a strong face and a sweet smile.
Mary Ellen, they told her, had been safely started
on her way again at midnight. Chaddle Wallace
had taken her in his peddler’s wagon. Their news
well-nigh dissipated Rhoda’s anxiety. For, of all
the many fugitives he had hauled part or all the
way to the northern boundary she knew that not
one had failed to reach Canada in safety.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p>In the depths of humiliation Rhoda mourned
over the fiasco of her attempt to guide Mary Ellen
to freedom. But she soon found that the fiasco
itself was bearing a rich crop of results. She was
indicted for aiding and abetting the escape of a
runaway slave and a dozen men of the rescuing
party for obstructing the United States marshal in
the performance of his duties and preventing him
from rendering back the fugitive. The anti-slavery
side retorted by arresting Gordon, the slave trader’s
agent, and the slave catcher accompanying
him, under the state’s personal liberty law, for
kidnaping, and several members of the marshal’s
posse, who had used fire-arms, for assault with intent
to kill.</p>

<p>As the news spread, meeting after meeting was
held all through the central and eastern part of
the state and up into the Western Reserve, denouncing
the law, expressing sympathy with its
victims and declaring the righteousness of setting
at naught its provisions. Through the southern
portion of the state and wherever there was sufficient
pro-slavery feeling to crystallize into such
action, counter-meetings were held, which reprobated
the unfairness to the South, characterized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
in contemptuous terms the actions and principles
of believers in the “higher law,” declared them to
be traitors and called upon the Federal Government
to use stern measures in upholding the Fugitive
Slave Act.</p>

<p>On the advice of Horace Hardaker, who was
to conduct her case, and that of the counsel for
her fellow prisoners, both Rhoda and they refused
to enter recognizance that they would appear
in court when wanted, and therefore were
compelled to remain in jail.</p>

<p>“It’s an unrighteous law in every respect,” said
Hardaker, “and our contention will be that it is
unconstitutional and void. To consent to return
for trial under it would make tacit recognition of
its validity. And that we won’t do. Besides,
staying in jail will make martyrdom out of it, and
the effect will be all the more potent.”</p>

<p>But Rhoda, although she saw that her failure,
in the outcome, would be of more consequence
than success would have been, felt the pangs of
humbled pride. She talked the matter over with
Rachel, Daniel Benedict’s wife. For between
her and the Quakeress a warm affection had quickly
developed. Rachel Benedict visited her as often
as the prison officials would allow, and Rhoda
soon found that the little, dove-gray figure, with
the sweet, strong face and the silver hair, was
sure to bring assuaging of her heartaches and renewal
of her spiritual strength. Without making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
any mention of her personal affairs, Rhoda yet
found it possible to talk with her new friend with
more intimacy and with greater surety of understanding
and response than she had ever been able
to do with her mother.</p>

<p>“I was so proud, so self-complacent,” she said,
“that I thought I could make amends to Mary
Ellen for the wrongs that had been done to her.
And I showed myself unworthy even to try. I
let her be taken, just by being wrapped up for a
few minutes in my own affairs, in something that
troubled me. Oh, it has been a bitter lesson!”</p>

<p>“Thee seems to me to be too much troubled by
thy repentance. If thee lets it engross thee it too
will become a sin. And perhaps the sin for which
thee is repenting does not deserve so much repentance,
after all. If thee did this thing believing
in thy inmost soul that it was right and
wishing in thy inmost soul to do good to others
by means of it, then don’t disturb thy heart, Rhoda
Ware, with how it seems to have come out. It
hasn’t ended yet. And thee can be sure there is
plenty of time yet for more good to come out of
it than thee ever dreamed of.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it didn’t make any difference to Mary
Ellen,” Rhoda answered thoughtfully, “for she
reached Canada just as safely as if I’d taken her
all the way myself. But such an awful wrong
had been done to her,—it seemed more horrible
than any other case I had known about, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
wanted to suffer for it myself. I wanted to make
atonement for another person’s sin. And it has
all ended in failure!”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t thee suffering for it? Isn’t thee
suffering a great deal more than if thee had been
successful? But don’t delude thyself, Rhoda
Ware, by thinking thee can do any good by suffering
for another person’s sins. We have got
to sweat and suffer stripes ourselves for the evil
that is in us if we are to be purged of our sins!”</p>

<p>At her window that night, Rhoda pondered
long upon these words. “I suppose Mrs. Benedict
is right,” she said to herself finally. “It was
only my pride—and my love, that made me think
I could atone for even this one bit of his wrongdoing.
He will have to suffer for it, for all of
it, himself, before he can see that it is wrong.
And we shall all have to suffer, North and South
alike, for this awful sin of slavery, for the North
is to blame almost as much as the South.</p>

<p>“‘Sweat and suffer stripes’! Bloody sweat,
father thinks it will be,—he is so sure that it will
end in war. Will it come in our time? Oh,
surely, things cannot go on like this much longer!
So much anger on both sides, so much indignation
in the North, so many threats in the South—and
all getting worse and worse every year—Oh, if
war is to be the end, we must be getting nearly
there! War!”</p>

<p>She shivered and pressed her hands against her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
face. As the grisly specter of blood and smoke
passed vaguely before her mind’s eye her anxious
thoughts hovered with instant anxiety over the
dear image of him who she knew would be among
the first to challenge the issue. Then with a little
cry she sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“Shall I never remember I must not think of
him like that!” she asked herself with bitterness.
“My sister’s husband! O, God, help me to forget!”
She paced about the room with frowning
brows and lips pressed hard together, telling herself,
as she had already done a hundred times, that
she must learn to forget, as it had been so easy for
him to do. And there she touched upon her
deepest wound, that his love had not been as fine
and as true as she had thought it.</p>

<p>“How could he love another—so different—and
wish to marry her, after all that has passed between
us? I could not—how could he?” was
the question that would come back, again and
again. She tried to subdue it by telling herself
that since he could, since his love and faith were
not equal to hers, he was not worthy of her love
and deserved only forgetfulness complete, eternal.
But her heart cried out fiercely against this edict
of her brain and clung to its need of believing in
him.</p>

<p>“He is fine and noble in many, many ways,” at
last she said to herself, “in nearly all ways the
finest and the noblest man I’ve ever known, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
his love fell short of all I thought it was, I must
try to forgive him that, as I forgive him his blindness
about the wickedness of slavery, which kept
us apart, and, I suppose—deep down in my heart—I
suppose—I’ll always love him. But I’ll try,
oh, I’ll try from this minute, always to think of
him as Charlotte’s husband. He mustn’t be Jeff
to me any more—just Charlotte’s husband! Charlotte’s
husband!”</p>

<p>During her days in jail she spent much time
embroidering dainty things for Charlotte’s trousseau,
and into these she found herself able to
stitch, along with the tears that would fall now
and then, prayers and hopes for Charlotte’s happiness
and earnest desires, since the marriage must
be, that she would make her husband happy. But
on this latter question she found herself haunted
by a doubt that would yield to no arguments based
on the sequence of love and happiness.</p>

<p>Charlotte and Mrs. Ware returned home immediately
after Rhoda’s arrest and it was some
time, after her sister’s first brief announcement of
her engagement, before she heard again from
either of them. And afterward their letters
were filled mainly with accounts of their plans and
preparations for Charlotte’s trousseau and wedding.
In her replies she could not bring herself
to write Jeff’s name and so referred to him only
as “Charlotte’s lover,” or “Charlotte’s intended.”
She noticed too that her mother spoke of him only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
in the same way while her sister wrote of him as
“he,” in capital letters.</p>

<p>“They are afraid of hurting my feelings by
mentioning his name,” I suppose, Rhoda said to
herself. “I must get used to it, but—I’m glad
they don’t.”</p>

<p>Charlotte’s letters were brief and infrequent
and each one contained, in addition to talk about
her bridal plans, advice in plenty on the propriety
of Rhoda’s giving up her “nigger thieving” and
her black abolition acquaintance, now that the
family was identified with southern interests.</p>

<p>“Dear little sister!” Rhoda would say to herself
with an indulgent smile as she read these
admonitions. “She’s such a child, and she’s so
positive she knows all about it! I wonder if she’ll
ever really grow up!”</p>

<p>But her mother’s letters gave her much concern.
Her arrest and imprisonment had caused
Mrs. Ware severe shock and deep grief and her
heart was wrung that the necessity was upon her
to cause so much suffering.</p>

<p>“I must do whatever I can,” she moaned. “It’s
on my conscience and I must, and I can’t be sorry
I did this, dear, dear mother, even for your sake.
I couldn’t live if I didn’t do my best to fight this
awful evil!”</p>

<p>Evidently, too, Mrs. Ware was not well. The
physical ailments that had interfered with her
enjoyment of her visit to Fairmount had grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
worse since her return. Notwithstanding all this
the mother heart of her yearned over and wished
to be with her first-born. But to this desire Rhoda
gave constant denial, lest her burden of grief and
pain be made harder to bear.</p>

<p>Dr. Ware came to see his daughter as often as
his practice would allow, but his visits were necessarily
brief and infrequent. He spoke occasionally
of Charlotte’s engagement and Rhoda thought
he seemed pleased with it.</p>

<p>“It’s a very good thing, I guess,” he said one
day, with a cheerfulness that gave Rhoda a little
twinge of unhappiness.</p>

<p>“But he always has loved Charlotte so much,”
she thought, “and wanted her to have everything
she wanted that he’d be glad to have her happy
no matter if—”</p>

<p>“She’ll be in harmony with her surroundings
and he seems to be very much in love with her,”
Dr. Ware went on. Rhoda turned quickly away
lest he see the little spasm of pain that she felt
sure was showing itself upon her countenance.</p>

<p>“Your mother, of course, is deeply pleased,”
he continued. “I don’t know but it is giving her
almost as much pleasure as your marriage would
have done. It will be a good thing for Charlotte
to be married happily and settled down. She’ll
come out all right. I never have had any doubts
about her, in the long run, because she’s so much
like what her mother was at her age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Horace Hardaker came often to consult with
Rhoda in the preparation of her case. He hoped
to make a telling presentment and was enthusiastic
over the excitement that already had been aroused.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said to her one day in the early
winter, when the date set for her trial was almost
at hand, “the law and the facts are all against us.
The only thing we can do is to appeal to the sentiment
against the law. Whether we lose or win,
the affair is making a big breeze that’s going to
be bigger yet!”</p>

<p>“You know, Horace,” she replied, “that I
don’t care in the least what they do with me,—except
on mother’s account. What I want most is
to help all I can in the fight against slavery and if
it will do more good for me to stay in jail than to
go home and work with the Underground again,
why then—” she looked straight at him and a
smile flashed from her lips up into her eyes—“in
jail let me stay!”</p>

<p>He smiled back at her and his blue eyes lighted
with admiration as he laid one hand for a moment
over hers. “Rhoda, I’ve told you this before,
but I must say it again, and I shall always say it—you’re
the grandest girl there is anywhere!”</p>

<p>After he was gone she sat with a tender smile
on her lips. “Dear Horace!” she was thinking.
“Such a good friend as he is! Sound and true to
the bottom of his heart! Why didn’t I happen
to fall in love with him?... Well, it seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
be getting nearly time—for me to refuse him
again!”</p>

<p>It was within a day or two of the opening of
her trial, which was to be the first of the series,
when Rhoda finally brought herself to the point
of writing to Jefferson Delavan. Many times
she had told herself that, since he was to marry her
sister, she ought to let him know that in her heart
were only wishes for his happiness. But it had
been a hard thing to do and she had postponed it
from week to week. At last, her sense of duty
would be put off no longer and she resolutely faced
the heartache that she knew the task would make
all the more poignant.</p>

<p>“Dear Friend,” she wrote. “Charlotte has
told me of the happiness that came to her and to
you during her visit to Fairmount. I am sure
you will believe me when I say it is my most
earnest wish that that happiness will never be any
less than it is now and that it will grow greater
during the many long years of wedded life that I
hope are before you. In your and her feelings
and convictions there is nothing to divide you,
nothing to prevent the complete union of hearts
and souls which is the only thing that can make
marriage worth while. I am sure, since you love
her, that you will always be very tender to Charlotte.
To me she has always been just ‘little
sister’ and it is difficult for me to realize that she
is really a woman and about to become a wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
At home we have always spoiled her and that has
made her, sometimes, in a merry way, rather ruthless
of other people’s feelings. But I have no
doubt your love will make you understand that
this is only on the surface and that her heart is
true and loving. For you both, dear friend, soon
to be brother, my heart is full of every good wish.
Always your friend, Rhoda”—she paused here,
on the point of signing her name in the old way,
but “Adeline” seemed sacred to those other days
and to the love that had been between them then,
and she could not write it here. So she added
only “Ware” and quickly folded and sealed the
letter.</p>

<p>As she looked at the envelope it seemed as if it
were the coffin of her love, ready for burial, as if
she had said a last good-by to all the pleasure it
had brought into her heart. Now only the pain
was left. She bowed her head upon her hands
and some scalding drops trickled through her
fingers. Her jailer’s knock sounded at the door
and she sprang to her feet and dried her eyes.
Hardly had she time to control her sobs when it
opened and Jefferson Delavan crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>His look was deeply earnest and intent upon
her as he moved forward, holding out both hands
and saying, “Rhoda! I could stay away no longer!”</p>

<p>“Jeff!” she faltered, stepping back. “I—I—had
just written to you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“Written to me! Rhoda! Did you ask me
to come?”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the look of glad surprise
and love that suddenly broke over his countenance.
Rhoda gazed at him in perplexity and
instinctively pressed one hand against her heart,
as if to keep down the responsive love that was
trying to leap upward, as she said to herself,
“Charlotte’s husband! Charlotte’s husband!”</p>

<p>Still moving backward, away from him, as he
followed her across the room exclaiming again,
“Sweetheart, did you ask me to come?” her bewildered,
apprehensive thought sprang to the conclusion
that she must make him be true to Charlotte,
that she must not let him betray the “little
sister.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte—” she ejaculated—“your engagement—I
wrote to wish you happiness!”</p>

<p>He stopped short and stared at her with puzzled
eyes. “What under heaven do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, your engagement to my sister! Aren’t
you going to marry Charlotte?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly, I’m not!” was his quick and
emphatic answer.</p>

<p>“Have you—have you—broken it off, then—so
soon?” She was moving her trembling hands
over each other, unable to keep them still, and
holding her face half averted, afraid to look at
him save in brief glances, lest her eyes might
betray the love that was swelling in her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“You are talking in puzzles, Rhoda! I’ve
never had the faintest desire to marry Charlotte,
or anybody but you.”</p>

<p>Her face dropped lower and her bosom heaved.
What could it all mean? Had they been deceiving
her? And why? “She said—that is—I
understood—” she stumbled. Then he broke in
upon her embarrassed bewilderment.</p>

<p>“She didn’t say she was going to marry me, did
she? Lloyd Corey is the happy man. It was
love at first sight, of the most violent sort, with
him, and he would take nothing but an outright
‘yes’ for his answer, and that inside of two weeks.
It was a pretty little love comedy, and I wished
a hundred times that you were there to watch it
with me.”</p>

<p>She moved unsteadily to a chair and sank down,
her face in her hands. It had been such tragedy
to her! And now it was taking all her self-control
to hold herself firmly in hand under the reaction.
At once he was beside her, dropping
upon one knee and trying to take her hands from
her face. “What is it, Rhoda? What is the
matter? Look at me, dearest!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jeff—let me realize—wait—one moment!”
He watched her anxiously, her hands in
his, as with a deep, long breath, a tension of the
muscles and a pressing together of her lips she
regained control of herself. She withdrew her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
hands and slowly lifted her face as he rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, Jeff—no, I don’t mean that—it
is so much. But—I thought—Charlotte led me
to think that—she was going to marry you—and
now—to find that you’re not—that you still—”
She stopped and half turned away her face, trying
to hide the confession she knew was there of all
it meant to find that his love was still her own.
But already he had seen enough to set his heart on
fire and he sprang toward her, as if to take her
in his arms.</p>

<p>“And you cared so much? Rhoda, deny me
no longer!”</p>

<p>She drew away from him and said humbly:
“Can you forgive me, Jeff? Indeed, I would not
have thought it possible, but it seemed to have
happened. It was just one of Charlotte’s tricks.”</p>

<p>“Forgive you, dear heart? I do not think you
could do anything that I would not forgive!”</p>

<p>Her glance swept the room. Then she looked
up at him with a smile and said significantly,
“Even this?”</p>

<p>“Even this, Rhoda, else I would not be here.
I held out against the pleading of my heart as long
as I could. But I longed so much to see you and
wanted so much to help you, that I couldn’t stay
away any longer. I’ve come, dear, to beg you
once more to be my wife. Let me give you, at
once, the protection of my name—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>She drew back and lifted her head proudly.
“I have already the protection of my father’s
name and the approval of my conscience. I should
feel myself a coward, and a traitor to myself, if I
tried to crawl under any other now.”</p>

<p>“I understand what you mean—and I beg your
pardon. But we both know now, more surely than
we knew before, how necessary we are to each
other, how deep and true and everlasting our love
is. Don’t you realize that neither of us can ever
be happy until we have joined our lives together?
What are the days and the weeks for us now but
just a constant yearning for each other’s presence.
Look forward, Rhoda, to months and years of
that, think of how much more life will mean for
us both, if only you will give up and listen to
what your heart tells you.”</p>

<p>She had risen and was standing beside her chair,
one hand on its back. He came close to her and
rested his hand near hers. She was conscious too
that his other arm was outstretched behind her,
hovering close, ready to sweep her into his embrace.
The struggle in her heart, longing to
heed the call of his, quick with desire to make
amends for the injustice she had done him,
tumultuous with rejoicing that his love had been
all she had thought it, was almost more than she
could bear. He was so near—she had only to
lean toward him a little, and his arm would be
around her and her head upon his breast. Ah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
the blessed peace there would be in that haven of
repose! Already she could feel its stilling waters
wrapping round her, numbing the power of resistance.</p>

<p>He leaned a little nearer and his voice was low
and compellingly sweet, “Rhoda! Come to my
arms, where you belong! Do not deny our love
any longer!”</p>

<p>She saw his hand on the back of the chair moving
instinctively toward her own,—a sinewy,
brown, masterful hand, which held her eyes as it
drew nearer, little by little, as if drawn by some
irresistible attraction. She knew that his eyes in
that same way were fixed upon her own, long,
slender, nervous, the sort of hand that works out
the behests of a strenuous soul. And she knew,
also, as she waited, silent, trying to force herself
to voice once more the dictates of her conscience,
she knew that, if his hand touched hers before she
could bring herself to speak, she could resist no
longer. Still she stood, speechless, her fascinated
eyes upon his masterful hand, her body thrilling
with the surety that if she did not speak now, at
once, in another moment she would be in his arms,
and the struggle over.</p>

<div class="first2">“Oh, my poor Nellie Gray,</div>
<div class="verse">They have taken her away,</div>
<div class="verse">And I’ll never see my darling any more!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The words of the negro song, in a negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
woman’s voice, came floating into the room,
mingled with the sounds of broom and scrubbing
brush. They brought to Rhoda instant memory
of Mary Ellen’s melodious tones, singing in happy
unconsciousness of peril, and of her own strained
and fearful attention as she listened to the footsteps
steps of the marshal’s posse. And then like a
flash passed before her mind’s eye the ashen face
and shaking figure of Mary Ellen, as her father
and Jim lifted her from the box that had almost
been her deathbed.</p>

<p>The numbing waters fell away, she raised her
hand and pressed it against her heart with the
impulsive, unconscious gesture he knew so well,
and moved apart.</p>

<p>“Jeff, it’s no use talking any more about this,”
she said in tremulous accents. “The last time we
said all that is to be said.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that! It makes everything so bare
and hopeless! It makes me fear that you have
killed your love. Rhoda, you do love me, yet?”</p>

<p>She turned slowly toward him and lifted her
downcast face, alight with all the glow that was
in her heart. “Jeff,” and the word as it came
from her tenderly smiling lips was a caress, “Jeff,
I love you so much that my heart has made me
forgive you even that you allowed Mary Ellen—Lear
White—to be sold.”</p>

<p>“My sweet! And I love you so much that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
heart has made me forgive even your stealing her
away!”</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed to them that gray eyes
and brown melted into each other. And then the
comedy of their cross-conscienced hearts struck
her sense of humor, the corners of her mouth
trembled and deepened and a smile flashed over
her face and sparkled in her eyes. At that they
both laughed, softly, in the tenderness of perfect
understanding. Then she saw the old baffled,
determined look overspread his face as turning
sharply he strode across the room and back.</p>

<p>“My God, Rhoda! Why have our hearts
snared us into this misery? Why don’t you
loathe me as you do all that I believe in and stand
for? Why can’t I condemn and scorn you as I
do all the rest of your tribe? Why must I, when
I detest and am injured by what is dearest to you,
still see in you my ideal of all that is lovable and
womanly? My love, my love, why can’t I hate
you instead of loving you so that you are the only
woman in all the world I want for my wife? Must
our love be forever a curse instead of a blessing?”</p>

<p>He flung himself into a chair beside the table,
every muscle of his body expressive of anger and
rebellion at the mysterious forces of human life
that had played this scurvy trick upon them,
pitted against each other loving heart and steadfast
conscience and left them, like two cocks in a
pit, to fight it out in a struggle to the death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>Did they laugh at him and at her, those Caliban
spirits of the universe, that with grim and
cruel humor are forever setting human purpose
awry and sending it, lop-sided and ludicrous, far
aside its mark? Did they laugh and cheer and
find pleasure in that struggle, the sure result of
the innate upward-strivingness of the human soul,
like human beings around a cock-pit betting upon
which instinct, which spirit, which physique, shall
prove the stronger? Or, perhaps, was Caliban
pushed aside by some Angel of the Sword, infinitely
just and infinitely merciful, that with stern
lips whispered to pitying eyes, “No, let them
struggle, for only by struggling, even to the uttermost,
can their souls grow!”</p>

<p>Softly Rhoda came near, hesitatingly put forth
one hand and let it rest for an instant upon his
arm. At her touch he straightened up and unconsciously
one hand sought the place upon his
arm where hers had lain. “I don’t believe, dear,
it will be forever. I don’t believe it will be very
much longer.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Rhoda?” he cried, springing
up. “Do you really think there is hope for
us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jeff, I do. But I don’t suppose you’ll
see it as I do. It’s only that I think,” she was
speaking timidly, and yet with a grave eagerness
of voice and manner, “and so do a good many of
us, that slavery can’t last much longer. We feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
sure that its end is bound to come, in one way or
another, and that before long. And when slavery
is swept away, Jeff, and the whole country is clean
of it, then there will be no gulf between us!”</p>

<p>Her serious eyes were luminous as they met his
unbelieving ones and in her face was the subdued
glow of one who looks afar off upon a land of
promise and knows that toward it his feet are set.
Love and disbelief were mingled in the somber
countenance he bent upon her.</p>

<p>“No, Rhoda, I do not agree with you. And
much as I love you, sweet, I would not, if I could,
purchase our happiness at such a cost. I would
not, if I could, be such a traitor to the South. But
I shall always love you, dear heart, and I shall
always hope that you will yet be mine.” He
held her hand tenderly for a moment in both of
his, pressed it to his lips, bowed gravely, and left
the room.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p>“It’s going to be a good speech, Horace, and it
will surely attract attention,” said Rhoda Ware
to her counsel on the day before the opening of
her trial.</p>

<p>Hardaker had just gone over with her an outline
of the address he would make in summing up
her case. It was intended for the people outside
the court room, near and far, who would talk
about it and read it in the newspapers, quite as
much as for the ears of the jurors. So high and
strong had risen the feeling on the slavery question
that in some parts of Ohio, as well as elsewhere,
the lawyer who devoted energy and ability
to the defense of captured fugitives and their helpers
could be sure of early and ample political reward.
Hardaker was ambitious. He meant, as
soon as he could reach an opening door, to enter
upon a public career and he had mapped out for
himself election to Congress, and after that a
steady ascent to high places in national affairs—such
a career as, half a century ago, engaged the
talents and aspirations of ten times as many eager
and capable young men as now think it worth
consideration. The fact is an ugly one and not
creditable to the quality of our national growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>But for Horace Hardaker in this present case
the spurrings of ambition were only an added incentive.
His conviction was profound that slavery
was an evil and the Fugitive Slave Act a monstrous
law and his desire to oppose either or both
or anything that tended to strengthen the institution
of slavery amounted to a passion. And, in
addition to these motives, his intimate friendship
with Dr. Ware and his love for Rhoda incited him
to exert himself to the utmost in her defense.</p>

<p>“I hope it will, Rhoda,” he replied, “but I’m
doubtful if it will do you any good. Your violation
of the law was open and flagrant and we
don’t want to deny it or attempt to mitigate it in
the least.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we don’t.”</p>

<p>“The decision in the case, then, will depend
entirely on the political sympathies of the jury,
and the other side is not likely to allow any man
on it who has anti-slavery convictions. It would
be a victory worth while, Rhoda, if I could get
you off! Not only for you, which would gratify
me enough, but for the anti-slavery cause! To
have conviction refused in a case as bare-faced as
this would be a big blow toward making the Fugitive
Slave law a dead letter!”</p>

<p>“If I could think,” said Rhoda earnestly, “that
any act of mine would help to bring that about,
I’d be willing to undergo this all over again.”</p>

<p>He looked at her admiringly and drew his chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
nearer, as he said: “Well, you can rest assured
that your attempt to help Mary Ellen is having
important results. And the waves are spreading
out and getting bigger, Rhoda!” Another hitch
brought his chair still closer.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that, and I want you to remember,
Horace, when you are making your speech, that
you are not to consider me or my sentence at all.
Say the thing that will help toward what we all
want. Don’t think about me—just think about
Mary Ellen and what she was willing to undergo,
and all the rest of those poor black creatures that
are longing so for their freedom.”</p>

<p>His chair was beside hers now and he was seizing
her hand. “Rhoda! Not think about you!
How can I help it? Don’t you know I’m always
thinking about you and always hoping that some
day you’ll think better about what I’ve been hoping
for so long? Isn’t there any chance, any
prospect of a chance, for me yet?”</p>

<p>She laid her free hand upon his two that were
clasping hers. “I’m sorry, Horace! You know
how much I like you, how much I prize your
friendship—but you are like a dear brother to
me, Horace, and I can’t think of you any other
way!”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it possible that sometime—don’t you
think, Rhoda, that after a while you’ll learn to
like me the other way too? You know what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
am, you know how much I love you—won’t my
heart’s love draw yours, after a while?”</p>

<p>She shook her head and drew her hands away.
“No, Horace, there isn’t any hope, not the least
in the world. And I wish, dear Horace, I wish
you would put it quite out of your mind. Don’t
waste any more time thinking about me. There
is many a nice girl who would make you a good
wife, and I do wish, Horace, for your own sake,
you would fall in love with one and marry her.”</p>

<p>He looked at her searchingly. “When a girl
talks that way she really means it.”</p>

<p>“You know I mean it, Horace.”</p>

<p>“I mean, Rhoda, that she knows her own heart,
clear through, and feels sure about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I know mine,” she answered
softly.</p>

<p>He seized her hand again as he exclaimed,
“Does that mean, Rhoda, that there is some one
else and that your heart is full already?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Horace. It means that I love some one
else so deeply that I can never have a love thought
for any other man. I love him with all my heart,
although I don’t suppose I shall ever marry him.
But I shall never marry any one else, and I could
no more think of you or any one else with the kind
of love you want than I could if I were his wife.”</p>

<p>There was something like reverence in the
gesture with which he put down her hand. “Then
that is the end of it for me, Rhoda. Would you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
mind telling me, is it that”—he paused an instant,
supplying mentally the adjective with which he
usually thought of Rhoda’s lover—“slaveholder,
Delavan, from Kentucky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Horace.”</p>

<p>He rose and took up his hat. “If that’s the
way it is with you,” he began, then stopped, looking
fixedly. “Poor girl!” he went on, resting his
hand lightly for an instant upon her head. “You
ought to have had a happier fate!”</p>

<p>“It’s as good as I deserve, Horace,” she replied
cheerfully. Then her face lighted with the
glow that had been in her heart since Delavan’s
visit, and she went on: “And it might have been
so much worse!”</p>

<p>That same glow, as of profound inward happiness,
was upon her countenance the next day as
she sat in the court room. On one side of her
was her father and on the other sat Rachel Benedict,
with wrinkled hands primly folded in the lap
of her plain gray gown, her kindly, bright old
eyes and sweet smile bent now and then upon her
young friend as she whispered some encouraging
word. Behind her were Mrs. Hardaker and
Marcia Kimball and other friends from the Hillside
Female Anti-Slavery Society.</p>

<p>In the back of the room, throughout the trial,
sat Jefferson Delavan. He was always in his
place in the same seat, when she entered, and
their eyes would meet once and a faint smile play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
around her lips for an instant. Then she would
not look again in his direction, but her face kept
always its glow of inward happiness.</p>

<p>Horace Hardaker sat with his gaze moodily
fixed upon Delavan’s dark head. Jeff’s eyes were
upon Rhoda’s face and Hardaker felt resentfully
that within their depths must lie some hint of the
lover’s yearning. It was almost time for him to
begin his address. But his thoughts were not
upon what he was about to say nor upon how he
could most move the jury. Instead they were
busy, with indignant wonder, upon how “that
damned slaveholder” had contrived to win the rich
and undying love of such a girl as Rhoda Ware.</p>

<p>For the way of a man with a maid is always a
sealed book to other men. A woman can guess,
or she knows instinctively, how and why another
woman has won a man’s love. But the side of a
man’s nature with which he does his wooing is so
different from any manifestation of himself that
he makes among his fellows that to them it is an
unknown land. Therefore they are inclined to
be skeptical as to its attractiveness.</p>

<p>But Hardaker was much more than skeptical.
He was irritated, and even angry, that “such a
man as that” should have dared to think himself
worthy of Rhoda’s love. And when he presently
rose to address the jury the rankling in his heart
lent sharper vigor to every thrust he made against
the slave power and put into his tones a savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
indignation as, with eyes fixed upon Delavan’s
face, he thundered his indictments.</p>

<p>An audience of character and intelligence
crowded the court room to the doors, while outside,
in the hall and around the windows people
stood on benches, listening intently, for hours at
a time. From all over the county, from surrounding
counties, and from as far away as Cleveland,
men of substance and of prominence had
left their homes and business and journeyed hither
to listen to the proceedings and to testify by their
presence their sympathy with the defense.</p>

<p>But the pro-slavery side also had its representatives,
although in the minority, who were of equal
consequence and standing. It was such an audience
as would gratify any attorney, wishing to
influence the community as well as the jury.</p>

<p>As he rose for his address Hardaker presented
a manly, attractive figure and a vigorous, almost
a magnetic, personality. Sweeping the court
room with his eyes, he waited for a moment and
then began with a couplet from a popular anti-slavery
song, a song that had roused the echoes
in thousands of enthusiastic gatherings, all over
the North. No one within the reach of his voice
needed any explanation of its meaning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“’Tis the law of God in the human soul,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis the law in the Word Divine.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He quoted the injunction of the Mosaic law
against the returning of an escaped servant and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
the commands of the New Testament for the succor
of the oppressed, and in vivid language set
them forth as the law of the Divine Word, the
command of God, and therefore infinitely more
binding upon men and women who believed in God
and accepted the Bible as his Word than any law
made by man in defiance of the Almighty’s command.
In a voice that gave full value to its
pathetic appeal he told the story of Mary Ellen’s
heroic endeavor to escape from bondage and a
fate “like unto the fires of hell.” Then he called
upon the fathers and mothers of all young girls
to tell him if the command of Christ, “Do unto
others as you would that others do unto you,” had
lost all its meaning, if humanity, Christianity,
fatherhood—even ordinary manhood—no longer
felt its force. Following the precedent set by a
number of lawyers of wide reputation he analyzed
the relation of the Fugitive Slave Act to the Constitution
and concluded that it violated the rights
guaranteed by the basic law of the country, and
therefore, since it was unconstitutional, to disregard
its provisions was not unlawful and his client
had committed no crime.</p>

<p>“This law was passed at the behest of the
slave power,” he declared. “It was conceived in
iniquity, the iniquity of the South’s determination
to put upon slavery the seal of national approval;
it was begotten in corruption, the corruption of
compromise and bargain; and it was born in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
dastardly willingness of misrepresentatives of
the people to truckle to Southern arrogance and
betray the convictions and the conscience of the
North.</p>

<p>“Shall we then, free men and women of Ohio,
betrayed as we have been and misrepresented as
we are by this so-called law, be expected to cast
aside the commands of Christianity and the obligations
of common brotherhood, transform ourselves
into bloodhounds to chase the panting fugitive
and send him back to his chains and, as in this
case, to such a hell of lust and vice as all decent
manhood and womanhood must shudder at? In
the name of all that humanity holds sacred, I
answer, no! A thousand times, no!</p>

<p>“The learned counsel for the prosecution has
seen fit to sneer at our belief in the higher law,”
Hardaker went on, with body erect and hand upraised,
his full, melodious, resonant voice filling
the court room and the corridors and carrying
his words even into the street. “I answer that
that law has my entire allegiance and that I stand
here to defend and uphold it and to demand the
rights of those who feel bound, as I do, by its commands.
I feel assured, and you well know, gentlemen
of the jury, that I voice the sentiments of
thousands upon thousands of Christ-loving and
God-fearing men and women when I say that if
any fleeing bondman comes to me in need of
help, protection, and means of flight, so help me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
the living God in my hour of greatest need, he
shall have them all, even to the last drop of my
life’s blood!”</p>

<p>Like the sudden upburst of a volcano, the court room
broke into resounding applause. Men
sprang to their feet, swung their hats and cheered.
Women stood upon benches, waved handkerchiefs
and clapped their hands. The rapping of the
judge’s gavel and the cries of the officers for
“order in the court” were drowned in the uproar
and hardly reached even their own ears. Then
the sharp insistence of hisses began to be heard.
Jefferson Delavan, who had been listening with
hands clenched, frowning brows and angry eyes,
added his voice to the sounds of disapproval. For
a few minutes the tumult continued, and then, at
the judge’s order, the court officers began forcing
the people out.</p>

<p>They poured into the street and organized a
mass-meeting in the square in front of the court
house. Numbers of men came running from all
directions and while the meeting was in progress
word filtered out that the jury had found the
prisoner guilty and the judge’s sentence had imposed
a fine of one thousand dollars and costs and
imprisonment for thirty days.</p>

<p>Resolutions were at once passed denouncing the
judge and deciding, “since the courts no longer
dispensed justice,” to proceed to the jail, liberate
the other prisoners and protect them from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
operations of “an outrageously unjust and tyrannous
enactment.”</p>

<p>Delavan, looking on at the outskirts of the
gathering, heard the resolutions. He knew that
Rhoda would soon be conducted back to her
quarters in the jail and he ran thither, hoping to
arrive before the crowd of rescuers. In custody
of the marshal she had just reached the jail
entrance.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” he exclaimed. “You are in danger
here! A mob is coming to break in the doors.
Marshal, bring her with me, so we can find a
place of safety for her.”</p>

<p>She drew herself up and looked at him with the
same pale face and brilliant eyes with which in
the woods, so long ago, she had opposed his quest
for his fugitive slave. Scarcely she seemed the
same being who, only a few days before, had
almost trembled into his embrace.</p>

<p>“No,” she said slowly, “these are my people
and with them is where I belong. This is where
your law has sent me and while I am in its power
I want no place of safety. Marshal, take me
in!”</p>

<p>The marshal was doubtful, asked Delavan
what he meant and what he purposed to do, and
while he hesitated the mob came rushing up the
street and his only course was to hurry inside with
her and bar the door.</p>

<p>The mass of men surged against the jail entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
and with pieces of timber and bars of iron
soon forced their way in. Then they trooped
through the building, sweeping along all the prisoners
who were awaiting trial under the Fugitive
Slave law. They urged Rhoda to walk out into
freedom and defiance of her sentence. But she
smilingly shook her head and told them:</p>

<p>“No, thank you. It’s better to serve out my
sentence, and then I’ll be free to defy the law again
in my own way.”</p>

<p>Exultantly the throng poured out into the street
again with the prisoners, and faced two companies
of militia, ready to fire. Even the hottest heads
among them paused at this and after some parleying
they agreed to disperse and allow the men to
be taken back to confinement.</p>

<p>Among those awaiting trial for aiding in Mary
Ellen’s rescue and escape were the pastor of the
leading Presbyterian church in the town, the
superintendent of a Methodist Sunday School, a
professor from Oberlin College who had happened
to be in the place on that day, a merchant,
two lawyers and a physician, together with some
clerks, laboring men, a farmer and several free
negroes. The day following the conclusion of
Rhoda’s trial was Sunday, and the Presbyterian
minister preached from the jail yard to a large
concourse of people who stood for two hours in a
biting wind, for it was now well on in the winter,
listening with the closest attention. The sermon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
which was mainly an anti-slavery address, added
fuel to the already flaming excitement.</p>

<p>Meetings were held and bands of men began
to organize and arm themselves. Militia guarded
the jail night and day. The pro-slavery sympathizers,
though in the minority in this region,
yet made up a considerable share of the populace,
and, angered and uneasy, they also began to prepare
for whatever might happen. To hints that
the Fugitive Slave law prisoners might yet be
delivered from jail they retaliated with threats
that those of their own party who were under
durance for infraction of state laws should no
longer suffer imprisonment.</p>

<p>So acute did the situation become that Governor
Chase hurried to Washington to consult with
President Buchanan, assuring him that while he
intended to support the federal government, as
long as its authority was exercised legitimately,
nevertheless he felt it his duty to protect the state
officials and the state courts and that this should
be done, though it took every man in the state to
do it.</p>

<p>Finally, a compromise was arranged by which
the federal government dropped the remaining
prosecutions for the escape of Mary Ellen and
released the prisoners, while the state authorities
dismissed the suits against the slave trader’s agent
and his companion and the members of the marshal’s
posse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>The episode was amicably settled, but the flames
of contention had been so fed by it that they
mounted higher and higher. Meetings continued
to be held all over those portions of the state
where anti-slavery sentiment was strong. They
culminated, soon after Rhoda’s release, in an immense
mass-convention at Cleveland attended by
many thousand people and addressed by public
men of distinction, where, amid the greatest
enthusiasm, resolutions were passed denouncing
the Dred Scott decision and declaring the Fugitive
Slave Act unconstitutional and therefore void.</p>

<p>In the pocket of the dress she had worn on the
day of her arrest Rhoda chanced to find, soon after
this convention, Charlotte’s note telling of her
engagement. She smiled soberly as she thought
of all the consequences that had resulted from
this manifestation of her sister’s puckish spirit.</p>

<p>“If she hadn’t misled me this way,” Rhoda’s
thoughts ran, “I wouldn’t have forgotten about
everything else the way I did for a few minutes,
and I would have kept watch of Mary Ellen and
made her keep her veil down, and then that man
wouldn’t have recognized her, and we’d have gone
right on and nothing would have happened!”</p>

<p>Rhoda’s trial aroused the keenest interest all
over the North. But it was an interest that cared
only for principles. The personalities of those
engaged in the matter were of the slightest consequence.
Everywhere, in newspapers and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
conversation, there was discussion of the affair,
and of the consequences to which it might lead.
But the people concerned in it were only so many
cogs in a mighty Wheel of Fate, turning resistlessly,
and ever about to bring into the present,
out of the unknown future, no man could tell what.</p>

<p>To the South and its northern sympathizers
the whole affair was irritating and alarming in high
degree. Democratic newspapers and their readers
declared the attitude of “Chase and his abolition
crew” to be equivalent to a declaration of
war against the United States and welcomed the
prospect, while the compromise by which the difficulty
was finally settled they described with bitterness
as “another triumph” for the creed of the
“traitorous higher law with its open sanction of
treason and rebellion.”</p>

<p>But there was one element in the North to whom
Rhoda Ware’s share in these events was not a
matter of indifference. In the eyes of the abolitionists
she was a martyr to the cause to which
they were zealously devoted and during the month
in which she served out her sentence letters poured
in upon her containing money for the payment of
her fine and warm words of praise. The Female
Anti-Slavery Society of Hillside sent her the whole
of their small store, saying, “we shall be proud to
share even so little in the martyrdom of our beloved
president.” Rhoda wept over it, knowing
well at what cost of personal sacrifice the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
hoard had been gathered. But she knew, too,
that to beg them to take back their offering would
be to stab their very hearts. Other anti-slavery
societies in Ohio and elsewhere sent contributions.
There were checks from rich men in New York,
New England and Pennsylvania, whose purses
were always open for the anti-slavery cause and
whose custom it was to give brotherly encouragement
to Underground operators who fell into the
toils of the Fugitive Slave Act by helping to pay
their fines. The amount in which Rhoda had
been mulcted was entirely paid, as was the assessment
in many another case, by these enthusiastic
co-workers.</p>

<p>Most precious to her, however, were the letters
which came from abolitionists all over the country
with their words of praise, sympathy, encouragement
and hope. Many of them were from men
and women whose names will be found in the
pages of American history as long as the conflict
over slavery holds a place therein. Long afterward,
when many years of peace had enabled all
the people of the land to look back with calm
philosophy upon those heated years of contention,
and the impartial muse of history had given to the
Underground Railroad a high place among the
causes which brought on the Civil War and abolished
servitude, Rhoda Ware held these letters
among her most prized mementos of those stirring
days of which she was a part.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p>The lilac bushes were again in bud and Rhoda
Ware was looking at them, pulling down here and
there a tall one to see if it was not farther advanced
than the rest, and reckoning how soon they
would burst into flower, when she saw a tall, erect
old man enter the gate. He came up the walk
with a peculiar directness of manner, as of one
accustomed to go forward with eyes and will upon
a single aim. As he approached and asked for
Dr. Ware, Rhoda saw in his face something of
that same quality of underlying sternness, a sternness
expressive rather of uncompromising moral
sense than of severity of feeling or of judgment,
that marked her father’s countenance. His silver-white
beard, long and full, lent to this austereness
a patriarchal dignity.</p>

<p>She took him to her father’s door, but Dr.
Ware was engaged with a patient. The stranger
asked if it were not she who had been concerned,
the previous autumn, in the escape of the slave
girl, Lear White, and they talked of that affair
and of the consequences to which it led. She felt
a magnetic quality in his grave and mellow tones,
and in the steady gaze of his deep-set eyes, alert,
luminous, penetrating, she was conscious of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
compelling force that lies in the look of all men
able to impress themselves upon others. Presently
he told her who he was and she thrilled as she
heard him speak the words, “Captain John Brown,
of Kansas.”</p>

<p>“My father and I have spoken of you often,
Captain Brown,” she said, her eyes and face lighting
with the admiration which abolitionists felt
for the man whom already they regarded as a
hero.</p>

<p>“Yes. We have known each other for many
years, and we have been agreed about slavery
since a time when there were so few of us that we
all felt as brothers.”</p>

<p>She had many questions to ask of matters in
Kansas, where, she found, he knew the husband of
her friend, Julia Hammerton. As they talked
she saw presently that his eyes were fixed upon
Bully Brooks, who, in full grown feline dignity,
was sunning himself on the veranda. The cat’s
air of complacent ease disappeared and, after some
worried movements, it suddenly sprang up with
arched back and swelling tail, spat its displeasure
and ran away. Charlotte, coming in at the east
gate, saw her pet’s performance and shot a questioning
glance at Rhoda and the stranger as she
passed them.</p>

<p>A little later, when her father had taken Captain
Brown into his office, Rhoda found Charlotte
with Bully Brooks in her lap, alternately soothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
his ruffled dignity and stirring him to angry protest.</p>

<p>“Rhoda, who is that horrid old man?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“Why do you call him horrid? He is the
finest, noblest-looking old man I’ve ever seen, and
his character is as noble as his appearance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, la! I asked you who he is.”</p>

<p>Rhoda hesitated, considering whether or not
it would be prudent to let Charlotte know the
identity of her father’s visitor. For there was
much pro-southern sentiment in Hillside and, although
John Brown was not yet an outlaw with
a price on his head, he was detested and considered
an active enemy by all friends of the South.
Charlotte noted her pause and bent upon her a
keen gaze. Apparently Rhoda did not want to
tell her who he was and therefore it became at
once an urgent necessity for her to find out.
Rhoda felt those intent brown eyes studying her
face and decided it would be better not to give
her sister reason for suspecting any mystery.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s some old nigger-stealer,”
Charlotte was saying, still watching Rhoda’s expression,
“and that’s why you think he’s such a
noble character. Lloyd thinks, and so do I, that
nigger-stealing ought to be punished by hanging.”</p>

<p>Rhoda smiled at her. “Would my little sister
like to see me hanging from a limb of that maple
tree yonder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“But you’d quit if you knew you were going to
be hung for it.”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Charlotte regarded her with wide eyes. In
her secret heart she was beginning to feel not a
little awe of this quiet elder sister upon whose
countenance she sometimes surprised a look of exaltation.
And therefore, to save her own sense of
dignity, immensely increased by the prospect of her
marriage, she had taken refuge in a patronizing
manner.</p>

<p>“Of course you would,” she said, with a superior
air and a toss of her pretty head. “You say that
just to brave it out. Has old Mr. White-Beard
come to help you make plans to get arrested
again?”</p>

<p>“No. He wanted to see father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well! Who is he? John Brown, or
Horace Greeley, or Governor Chase? One of
them is as bad as another and they’re all tarred
with the same brush.”</p>

<p>“Which do you think?” asked Rhoda calmly.</p>

<p>Charlotte leaned forward, all eagerness, her
intuitions, as they so often did, flashing straight
to the truth. “Not John Brown?” she ejaculated.
Rhoda nodded, and Charlotte drew back with a
little gasp and then seized the cat in her lap with
extravagant exclamations of pride and affection.</p>

<p>“My precious Bully Brooks! You knew who
he was, didn’t you, and you told him what you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
thought of him! He’s a regular old ogre, Rhoda,
and Bully Brooks felt it, didn’t you, you darling
cat! And you shall go with Charlotte, when she’s
married, to Corey’s Hall, so you shall, where there
won’t be any nigger-stealers to make you angry.”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked on with amusement. Not even
yet, although Charlotte’s wedding day was fast
approaching, could she think of her sister as other
than a merry sprite, a spoiled child, of whom it
would be too much to expect the sense of ordinary
responsibilities. But now a feeling of uneasiness
grew upon her, and when presently both rose to
go into the house she said:</p>

<p>“By the way, sister, please remember that it is
not necessary for you to tell any one about Captain
Brown’s being here, either now or after he
has gone.”</p>

<p>Charlotte tilted her chin saucily and laughed.
“Don’t you know, Rhoda, that I never make
promises—except for the fun of breaking them?
Besides, I’m a southerner now.”</p>

<p>Rhoda laid her hand gently upon the other’s
shoulder. “Stop, sister. This is a serious matter.
I can’t forget that once you played the
traitor—pardon me, there is no other word for it,
although I don’t think you meant it that way—but
it was the traitor to father and to me. You
know how much father loves you and how he’ll
miss you after you’re married. Do you want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
make him feel so much safer then that he can’t
help being glad you’re gone?”</p>

<p>It was a new experience for even Rhoda to take
her reckless audacities with so much seriousness,
and she looked up wonderingly, at first with pouting
and then with trembling lips. “I don’t see
why you want to make me so unhappy at home,
when I’m soon going to leave it,” she sobbed.
“Do you want to make me hate my home and be
glad to go away?”</p>

<p>Rhoda longed to take the dainty, drooping little
figure into her arms and speak words of soothing.
But she held to her purpose. “Do you want to
make father, who loves you so much, glad to have
you go away?”</p>

<p>Charlotte stamped her foot. “Of course I
don’t!” she exclaimed, her fists in her eyes. “And
you’re perfectly horrid to say such things!”</p>

<p>At once Rhoda gave way to compassion, for
she felt that she had gained her point. She drew
her sister within her arm, patting her shoulder and
kissing her forehead. “There, there, dear! Never
mind. I only wanted to make sure we could trust
you.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon when Dr. Ware was ready to
make his round of visits, he asked Rhoda to go
with him upon a trip he had to make into the
country. As they drove through the glistening
young spring he told her of his conversation with
his morning’s visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>“Captain Brown gave me permission to talk it
over with you,” he said. “I assured him you
could be trusted.” Rhoda’s heart swelled with
pleasure at her father’s words and at the matter-of-fact
way in which he spoke them, for both
words and manner made her know how habitual
with him their companionship had become.</p>

<p>“I’ve known him for a good many years,” Dr.
Ware went on, “and I’ve always believed that
some day he’d strike a big blow, square on slavery’s
head, do some big thing that would help
immensely to get rid of it. For a man of Brown’s
intelligence, character and personality can’t live
half his lifetime absorbed by one idea without
making something happen. He and I agree on
one point, that slavery can be wiped out only by
violence. We both see that its roots have gone
so deep that to pull them up will make a terrible
upheaval. He hasn’t the faith that I have, hasn’t
any, in fact, in political measures and the Republican
party. He doesn’t believe, as I do, that all
this is helping to keep the roots from spreading
and getting stronger, and that it will make our
victory quicker and easier, when the time for
violence does come.</p>

<p>“He thinks that time is nearly here and that he
is going to bring it about. He proposes to
establish himself, before long, somewhere along
the free-state border, with a band of picked followers,
drilled in arms, and gather into his fortified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
camp all the negroes from the near-by plantations.
Such of these as wish to go to Canada will
be passed on by the Underground, while those
who prefer will stay with him and help gather in
more slaves from greater distances. As the success
of his forays becomes known he thinks that
other men will join him from all over the North,
until his army, increased also by daring spirits
from among the fugitive slaves, will be so large
and formidable and slave property be made so
insecure that slavery will collapse like the shell of
a ruined house.”</p>

<p>Rhoda’s cheeks were flushed and her eyes shining.
“What a daring scheme, father! Do you
think it will succeed?”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware smiled doubtfully and shook his
head. “I don’t think he can carry it through to
the end he feels sure of, and I told him so this
morning. But his heart is set on it. He has been
slowly maturing the plan for twenty-five years,
and has even made a tour of the great battlefields
and important fortifications of Europe, studying
them in the light of this purpose. It seems to me
impossible that he can succeed. But he’ll scare
the South out of its wits and make it angrier and
more determined than ever, and that will be a
good thing. With the rising tide of public opinion
in the North, it will bring the clash that’s bound
to come a big notch nearer.”</p>

<p>“Did he want you to join him, father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>“Yes. I knew about his plan—we’ve talked
of it before. I have so much faith in the power
of the one-ideaed man to achieve things that I’ve
always told him he could call on me for any help
it was in my power to give. I’ve contributed
what I could to his Kansas campaign, and I gave
him this morning for this scheme all I could spare.
I told him, too,” Dr. Ware hesitated a little over
his words now, “that I might join him in person
somewhat later, if his first attempts prove successful,
and that perhaps you would come too. For
with your knowledge of nursing you would be
useful. Do you think you would care to throw
yourself into such a scheme as his, full of danger
and sure to fail, but likely to deliver an effective
blow?”</p>

<p>His eyes were upon her, clear and calm as
usual, but brilliant now with the fires of zeal. As
they searched her face her own looked back at
him, as glowing with zeal as his. “You know I
would, father—you did right to tell him so. I’m
always ready to go anywhere or do anything that
will help our cause. But—mother—what about
mother?”</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly and turned away.
“Your mother, Rhoda, is incurably ill. She cannot
be with us much longer. I had her consult
two physicians in Cincinnati on her way home
from Fairmount, and they both told her it is only
a question of time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>“Oh, father! Can’t we do anything for her?
Why didn’t you tell me before?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing we can do but make her as
comfortable and care free as possible while she is
with us. I didn’t tell you before because she
didn’t want you to know about it until after
Charlotte’s wedding, and she doesn’t want Charlotte
to know it at all. She wants everything to
be as cheerful and happy as possible while Charlotte
is here. Please don’t let her guess that you
know.”</p>

<p>Charlotte was to be married in May, and during
the remaining weeks of that time Rhoda
watched her mother with anxious and loving care,
taking upon herself, as Mrs. Ware seemed willing
to relinquish it, every household responsibility,
and noted with aching heart the wasting of her
face and figure.</p>

<p>“I believe she is just keeping up by her will
power,” Rhoda said to Dr. Ware, “so that there
shall be nothing to make Charlotte unhappy during
her last weeks at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented her father, “she wants Charlotte
to remember the months of her engagement
as the happiest time in her life. We must be prepared
for a reaction after it is all over.”</p>

<p>After Rhoda’s trial and imprisonment no mention
of that matter was ever made between her
and her mother. When she returned home Mrs.
Ware received her with the utmost love and tenderness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
but without the least reference to the reasons
for her absence. In neither words nor manner
did she recognize that that absence had been anything
other than an ordinary social visit and if it
had to be spoken of she referred to it merely as
the time “when you were away.”</p>

<p>So, now, she made no sign to either her husband
or her daughter that she had any knowledge of
the Underground activities in which they were
engaged or of the fugitive slaves who were sheltered
in the house. Rhoda was never able to
guess whether she knew much or little of what
went on under her roof nor whether or not she
resented it or was grieved by it. But the girl’s
heart ached constantly with sympathy for what
she felt must be her mother’s pain.</p>

<p>Her compassion and sorrow, however, did not
lead her to consider for a moment the idea of
giving up the work. Rather, they inspired her
to greater zeal, in both thought and action, and
to more intense desire to aid in the destruction of
slavery. For, in her mind, whatever grief her
mother felt, whatever alienation there was between
them, were among the evil results of the
slave system, just as was the division between her
and Jefferson Delavan, and the only way of rightfully
fully meeting them was to attack their cause.</p>

<p>At the wedding Rhoda was bridesmaid and
Delavan was groomsman. As she saw her
mother’s eyes fixed wistfully upon them she felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
fresh twinges of self-reproach. She knew the
deep pleasure that Charlotte’s marriage to a
southerner had brought to the ailing woman, and
she knew that this would be as nothing beside her
satisfaction and delight could she see her other
daughter united in marriage to the son of her old
friend. Could it be, after all, Rhoda began to
ask herself, that here was where her highest duty
lay? Ought she, at whatever cost to herself,
make happy her mother’s last days?</p>

<p>It seemed to Rhoda that everything conspired,
throughout the wedding festivities, to bring her
and Delavan alone together, although she knew
that they were both trying to avoid such meetings.
But he forebore to speak of love, and afterward
the merry friendliness of these brief occasions,
just touched as they were with the fragrance of
intimacy, were among her dearest memories.</p>

<p>When he bade her good-by she felt the lover in
his manner and his voice as he said: “It has been
two years, Rhoda, but I shall wait two years more,
and ten times that, before I give up hope of our
wedding!”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked at him with her flashing smile,
that lifting of her short upper lip and trembling
at its corners and lighting of her eyes, which always
sent through his veins a fresh thrill of love,
and answered: “Oh, Jeff! What a long time to
prepare for a wedding in!”</p>

<p>After it was all over Mrs. Ware failed rapidly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
Rhoda watched her wasting cheeks and growing
feebleness with an agony of compassion and
constant tumultuous questioning of herself. Her
mother had not spoken to her for a long time
about Delavan’s suit, but she knew that the wish
was gathering strength in her breast as she came
nearer and nearer to death’s door. Rhoda felt
it in the wistful look with which the brown eyes,
grown so large and childlike in the peaked face,
followed her about the room. It spoke to her in
the plaintive appeal of the soft southern voice
and it pulled mightily at her heartstrings in the
clinging to hers of the thin hands, a little while
ago so plump and fair.</p>

<p>With her own heart playing traitor, as it always
did with every weakening of her resolution, with
love and compassion for the invalid pleading incessantly,
with a remorse-wrung conscience recalling
every hurt she had ever given to her mother
and urging that she ought to salve those many
wounds with this final atonement, the torment of
it became almost greater than she could bear.</p>

<p>One day she found her father alone in his office
and, impelled by her distraught heart, she forgot
her usual restraints, flung herself on her knees
beside his chair and laid her face against his knee.</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” she begged, “help me to see what
I ought to do! I know mother wants me to marry
Jeff—she doesn’t say a word about it, but I feel
all the time that it is making her last days full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
sorrow. It seems to me sometimes that I can’t
stand it another minute, that I must give up, because
it will make her happy. Would it help her,
father, if I did?”</p>

<p>Dr. Ware laid his hand upon her shoulder.
Even in her wretchedness the action gave her a
little thrill of pleasure, for it was nearer a caress
than she could remember he had ever given her.</p>

<p>“Nothing can help your mother now, child.
With her, it is a matter of a few months, or
weeks, or, perhaps, even days. It would make
her happy for that little time—I know it as well
as you do. You could feel that you had enabled
her to end her days in peace. But whether or not
you ought to sacrifice your sense of right to your
sense of duty to her is something that only you
can decide.”</p>

<p>“I know it, father,” she answered in low tones
as she rose to her feet and wiped the tears from
her eyes.</p>

<p>She went out into the yard, gay with the luxuriant
blooms of early summer. The white petunias
sent up their fragrance and the memories it
brought pierced her very heart with poignant
sweetness. She went on into the grape arbor and
sat down in its cool shadows, asking herself why
it was that she could keep her own soul clean only
at the expense of another’s happiness.</p>

<p>“My happiness, Jeff’s happiness,” she thought,
“they are of our own making and we can choose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
our own conditions. But mother, poor, dear,
little mother, so sick, with such a little while to
live, and her happiness so bound up in this! And
if I do it I shall feel all my life that it was wrong,
that my soul isn’t clean. Oh, mother, how can I
become a part of this abomination of slavery, this
vile, accursed thing! I’d be glad to die, a hundred
times over, for you—but to live and be a
part of such wickedness— Oh, mother, how can
I? How can I?”</p>

<p>The end came sooner than they expected. On
a hot afternoon in midsummer, when the late, red
rays of the sun, shining through the half-closed
shutters, lay in bands across the floor, Mrs. Ware
called Rhoda. “Come close, honey, down beside
me,” she said, and Rhoda knelt at the bedside.
Her mother slipped a feeble arm around her neck.</p>

<p>“You’ve been a dear, loving daughter to me,”
she said, “even if we’ve thought so differently
about some things. You are like your father,
Rhoda, and that has always been a pleasure to
me. You’ve wanted to make me happy, just as
he always has, and in almost everything you have.
No mother ever had a better, dearer daughter than
you, honey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother,” Rhoda exclaimed, the tears welling
into her eyes, for in the pale, pitiful face she
saw the shadow of the death angel’s wing and felt
his near approach in the chill that struck into her
own breast. “Dear mother, I’ve never done half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
enough for you, never been half as good and loving
to you as you deserved!”</p>

<p>“Always you have, dear, except in one thing.
You know how much for two years I’ve wanted
you to marry Adeline’s son, dear Jeff. And you
would not. I haven’t much longer to live, and if
you want to make my deathbed happy promise me
that you will. Oh, Rhoda, send for Jeff and marry
him here beside my bed and have your dying
mother’s blessing!”</p>

<p>Rhoda was sobbing with her face upon her
mother’s shoulder. “Dearest mother,” she
pleaded, “don’t ask that of me.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only thing in all the world that I want,
honey. You love Jeff, and he adores you, and I
know that you’ll be happy together, if you’ll only
give up that nonsensical idea that has taken possession
of you. It’s your happiness that I want,
Rhoda, yours and Jeff’s. And I know, oh, so
much better than you do, what makes a woman
happy. I can’t die feeling that I have done my
duty to my little girl and made sure of her happiness,
unless she will promise me this. Will you
do it, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“Let me be the judge of my happiness, mother,
as you were the judge of yours!”</p>

<p>“Your mother knows best, child! Take her
word for it, and let her bless you with her last
breath, as you’ll always bless her if you do. It’s
the last thing she’ll ever ask of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>The invalid’s tones were growing weaker and
something querulous sounded in them as she repeated,
“Promise me, Rhoda, promise!”</p>

<p>The linked hands upon Rhoda’s neck loosened
their hold and the tired arms slipped down. She
bowed her head upon her mother’s breast as she
sobbed, “Let me think for a minute, mother, dear!
It breaks my heart not to do what you want!”</p>

<p>“It breaks mine, Rhoda, that you don’t. Oh,
honey, let me die in peace and happiness! Promise
me that you’ll marry Jeff!”</p>

<p>Rhoda saw that her father had entered the room
and was standing at her side. She sprang to her
feet, threw her arms about his neck and with her
head upon his shoulder burst into a passion of
tears.</p>

<p>“Father, tell me what to do!” she wailed.</p>

<p>His arms were about her, his face upon her hair,
and his tears were mingling with hers. In that
supreme moment of grief, compassion and struggle
the icy barriers that had kept their hearts
apart melted away and they clung together in their
common despair, groping through their sobs for
the right thing to say and do.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were startled by a gay little laugh
from the bed. “You’ve come at last, have you,
Adeline, dearest! How late you are!” the dying
woman exclaimed, holding out her hands in welcome.
From her face the shadow had passed and
in its place shone a girlish happiness. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
back again among the friends of her youth, chatting
and laughing with “dearest Adeline,” and
calling upon “mammy” to do this and that. And
so, babbling of her girlhood’s pleasures, she passed
into the dark beyond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p>During the late summer and autumn of that
year Rhoda and her father and their friends
watched with the keenest interest, as did people
all over the country, the struggle in Illinois between
Lincoln and Douglas. In the Cincinnati
and New York papers they read the speeches,
printed at length, of both the aspirants for senatorial
honors, and on many an evening, gathered
on the veranda of the Ware home or, after the
evenings grew cool, around the fireplace in the
living-room, they discussed all the features of that
famous intellectual wrestling match.</p>

<p>Horace Hardaker had been nominated for Congress
by the Republican party and was conducting
a vigorous campaign. Nevertheless, he found
time to come frequently up the hill to Dr. Ware’s
house for these talks. Marcia Kimball came also,
at first with her brothers, but after a little Rhoda
observed that it was oftener with Hardaker that
she made her appearance and always upon his
arm that she leaned when they went away. With
an inward smile Rhoda noticed too that Horace,
with apparent unconsciousness, began to address
his conversation mainly toward Marcia.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to be elected,” he said one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
evening, “that is, not this time. But I’m giving
the ground a good, deep plowing, and there’ll be
a different crop to reap two years from now.”</p>

<p>His opponent, a Douglas Democrat, won the
day, but by so narrow a margin that Hardaker
was almost as exultant as if he had been successful.
“Two years more of the way things are
going now,” he declared, “and we’ll sweep the
country!”</p>

<p>“Suppose you do, what good will it do?” said
old Mr. Kimball. “Your Republican party expressly
says it won’t interfere with slavery in the
South.”</p>

<p>“It will bring on a crisis,” interjected Dr. Ware,
“and a crisis is exactly the thing we want. The
South won’t stand a Republican president. And
when she tries to leave the Union the upheaval
will come.”</p>

<p>Not long after the election Hardaker sought
Rhoda in more buoyant mood than ever, to tell
her that he and Marcia were to be married. She
assured him that she was heartily glad, and really
felt all that she said, and even more. But her
sincere rejoicing did not prevent her from looking
sadly out of her window that night and feeling
that something very dear and pleasant had gone
out of her life beyond all recovery. She would
not, if she could, have held Hardaker’s love in
fruitless thrall, but it had been so comforting, so
gratifying, to know how surely it was hers and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
had so grown to expect one of his recurrent proposals
every year or so that it cost her a little
wrench now to give it all up.</p>

<p>“He’ll make Marcia a good, loving husband,”
she thought, “and with his talent and ambition
he’ll succeed. Oh, they’ll be happy, and I’m
glad.”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew sad and the lines of her face
drooped as she sat beside her window. And after
a while she took out the little box with its treasure
of letters and withered flower. She did not read
the letters, of which there was now nearly a box
full, but turned them over caressingly in her hands
and now and then pressed one to her lips.</p>

<p>Rhoda was bridesmaid when Horace and Marcia
were married in the early spring. “It’s your
third time, isn’t it, dear,” said Marcia as her friend
draped about her shoulders the folds of her bridal
veil. “I do hope it will be you yourself, next
time!”</p>

<p>“So do I, Marcia!” said Rhoda frankly, looking
up with a smile. “There isn’t a girl anywhere
who’d more willingly be a bride than I, if—if—if!”</p>

<p>“Rhoda, you’re the dearest, bravest girl!”
cried Marcia, squeezing her hand. “If I was in
your place I’d be crying my eyes out instead of
laughing like that!”</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t have you for my bridesmaid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
if you couldn’t give your eyes a rest that long,”
rejoined Rhoda gaily.</p>

<p>Spring and summer came and went, and for
Rhoda Ware the weeks passed with uneventful
flow. Through their house there trickled a thin
stream of slaves fleeing northward, sometimes
half a dozen or more within a week and sometimes
not more than one or two. The trouble and cost
of recovering their runaway negroes, even when
they were infrequently able to get possession of
them again, had caused the southern slaveholders
to give over their efforts. In these last years of
the decade it was unusual for a fugitive to be pursued
and therefore the traffic of the Underground
was carried on with little risk.</p>

<p>Rhoda busied herself with these duties, the
ordering of her father’s household, her anti-slavery
work and her reading. Gradually the thought
grew up in her breast that she would like to study
medicine. She talked the matter over with her
father and he offered, if she wished, to send her
to one of the medical colleges that within a few
years had been opened for women. But she would
not leave him alone and so, under his guidance,
she spent her leisure time reading in his medical
library, discussing his cases with him, and often
going with him upon his visits.</p>

<p>Dr. Ware received an occasional brief letter
from John Brown in which his scheme was referred
to with cautious phrasing as a speculation in sheep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
Toward midsummer he wrote that he was getting
his shepherds together and expected to collect a
band of sheep in the Virginia mountains, where he
thought there would be good pasturage, about the
middle of October.</p>

<p>“He is bound to come into collision with the
federal government very soon,” said Dr. Ware
to his daughter as they talked this letter over together.
“Of course he knows that will be the end
of his enterprise and of him too.”</p>

<p>“He won’t care,” answered Rhoda, “what becomes
of him if he can make just one thrust at
slavery.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. And the more I think of it the
more I believe that even if he fails in his first
attempt, as he is very likely to do, it will be a good
strong thrust that will make the South fairly stagger.
I told him I’d wait to see whether or not he
made a beginning before I decided about joining
him. But I doubt very much, Rhoda, whether
you and I will have a chance to work under John
Brown.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready to go whenever you say the word,
father,” she said with grave earnestness.</p>

<p>Now and then a letter passed between Rhoda
and Jefferson Delavan, a letter of intimate friendliness,
telling of personal matters and mutual
interests. Once only did he touch upon the slavery
question, which formerly they had argued with
such earnestness, and then he filled a long letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
with an endeavor to prove to her that the negro
race had been benefited by slavery, that in taking
it from its barbarous state and bringing it in contact
with civilization the slaveholders had lifted
it to a higher plane of moral and intellectual life.</p>

<p>When she replied she said merely, “No more
of that, please, if you still love me! Each of us
knows that the other’s convictions are honest and
deeply rooted. We can’t agree, so let’s not argue,
but just enjoy our friendship.”</p>

<p>Nor was there in their correspondence any
mention of love, or of possible or impossible marriage.
But toward the end of summer, when a
little band of men was warily gathering in a
Maryland farmhouse, one of Jeff’s letters set
Rhoda’s heart to fluttering. There was in it,
save for some terms of endearment which seemed
to have flowed unconsciously from his pen, no
putting into words of a lover’s hopes. But she
felt through every line the burning of the lover’s
heart. And a few weeks later there came a brief
note saying, “I shall be in Hillside soon and shall
count on seeing you.”</p>

<p>For a day Rhoda’s heart sang with joy, “He is
coming, he is coming! I shall see him, have him
here beside me!” and would listen to no warnings
of her mind.</p>

<p>Then she wrote, “Don’t come! I beg of you,
Jeff, don’t come! What is the use!” And lest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
her courage might fail her, she quickly sealed and
posted her missive.</p>

<p>But when the October woods were bright with
flaming color, and the little band of men in the
Maryland farmhouse were waiting for the order
to march, and Rhoda and her father were saying
to each other every morning, “There may be news
to-day,” Jefferson Delavan appeared at her door.</p>

<p>“I told you not to come!” she said, and gave
him her hand, while face and eyes belied the meaning
of her words. His heart gladdened at their
sweet shining as he held her hand in both of his
and answered, “And I disobeyed—because I
couldn’t help it.” Then, for a moment, their
starving, delighted gaze fed upon each other’s
eyes, until Rhoda suddenly felt that he was about
to break into lover’s speech. Impulsively she
laid a finger across his lips. He seized and held
it there while she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Don’t speak, Jeff, don’t say anything. It’s
such a lovely day—the hills are so beautiful—let’s
have a ride together!”</p>

<p>He agreed, glad of anything that would insure
her presence near him, and they were soon galloping
over country roads and across the wooded
hills, brilliant in the gala robes with which Nature
celebrates her thanksgiving for another year of
sun and life and growth.</p>

<p>As they rode, the motion and the wine-like air
and the joy in her heart lifted Rhoda into exultant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
mood, deepened the wild rose-bloom in her cheeks
and kindled her serious eyes into sparkling gaiety.
“Let me have this little time!” her heart pleaded.
“It may be the last. After <i>that</i> has happened he
may never come again!”</p>

<p>And so, with thrilling nerves and singing heart,
the Cavalier in her breast dominated the Puritan
and sent to the four winds warnings of conscience
and thought of to-morrow. Forgotten was the
safety of the three fugitive slaves, at that moment
hiding in her cellar, forgotten the fateful Thing
for whose birth in the Virginia mountains she had
been waiting, cast away from her mind was all
thought of the anti-slavery contest, nor was there
room in her heart for zeal in its cause. She was
mere woman, loving and beloved, and glorying inwardly
in her power over her lover. Her Cavalier
inheritance took possession of her and bade
her snatch the pleasure of the hour. Her father’s
offspring dwindled away into the smallest recesses
of her nature and it was her mother’s daughter
who sat in the saddle, slender and graceful, and
with starry eye and alluring smile kindled fresh
fires in her lover’s breast.</p>

<p>With pride and pleasure she saw them burning
in his face and eyes as he drew beside her and
murmured, “Rhoda, you are so beautiful!” Her
mirror had told her many times, and she had
agreed in its verdict, that she was not beautiful.
And so all the more precious to her was this tribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
of love, and more than once did she win it, as
they rode and rode, during the long afternoon.</p>

<p>A sudden memory came of the tale of courtship
her mother had told to her and Jeff, on that
June night so long ago, and across her mind’s eye
there flitted the vision she had often called up,
of the pretty, wilful girl and the resolute young
man with his hand on her bridle, galloping, galloping— “And
that was love—and this is love, and
it is mine!” her heart sang. Quickly her brain
flashed back the question, “Would I yield, as
mother did, if—if—if—” And the Cavalier in
her heart sang back, exulting, “I would! I would!”</p>

<p>On their way home they came to an old wood
road and turned into it from the cross-country
way upon which they had been galloping. Checking
their horses they rode slowly down the brilliant
avenue of gold and russet and crimson, talking,
now earnestly, now gaily, upon one or another
of the multitude of things, personal and impersonal,
which to lovers can bourgeon instantly into
matters of moment and interest by the mere fact
of mention in the loved one’s voice. Gradually
the road dwindled away and they came upon
steeper hills and a rocky surface. But Rhoda
knew where they were and said that by turning
sharply to the eastward they could gain the high
road. Dismounting they led their horses across
the hills, the fallen autumnal glories billowing
beneath their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>Already Rhoda’s mood had begun to sober.
The Puritan was claiming his own again. Down
that wood road she had driven her buggy, on a
winter day, to bring out the fugitive negro lad
whom she had sent flying to the cave for safety
from the pursuing marshal. They passed the
cave itself, where, more than three years previous,
she had hidden the mulatto, running for the freedom
dearer than life from this very man who was
bending near her now with ardent looks of love.
She shivered a little as she remembered the slave’s
sullen resolution, the pistol in his hand, and the
tone in which he had said, “I won’t go back.” As
Jeff bent with loving solicitude to draw her wrap
closer about her shoulders she was thinking, “And
he said they were brothers.”</p>

<p>They struck a path which climbed a steep hill,
and when they came to a jutting rock Delavan
looked around him with sudden recollection.
“Why, I’ve been here before!” he exclaimed. “It
was here I met you, dear, that day—don’t you
remember? What a long time you have made
me wait, sweetheart, for your promise!” His
lover’s longing, made a hundredfold more imperious
by the allurement there had been all the
afternoon in her laugh, her voice, her smile, her
lips, her eyes, her manner, would be put aside no
longer, and he turned upon her with an impetuosity
that would brook no protest.</p>

<p>“Do you, remember, dearest, the proof of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
love I gave you that day? I’m ready to give you,
here on this same spot, another proof, a thousand
times greater! It will sweep away everything
that keeps us apart, Rhoda! Everything!”</p>

<p>She looked at him silently, sweet wonder parting
her lips and shining starlike in her big gray eyes.
Her cheeks were paler now, with the ebbing of
the exultant tide that had kept her all the afternoon
on its crest. But to him this soft, subdued
mood bespoke the sweetheart ready to tremble into
his embrace and made her all the more adorable.
He seized her hand and she let it lie in his close,
warm grasp as he went on:</p>

<p>“I have made up my mind to give up everything
to our love. I will free all my niggers—for
the sake of your dear conscience not one shall
be sold—and see that they find places where they
can earn their livings. Then I will sell my property
and we will put this country and its accursed
contentions behind us. We will go to England,
dear heart, or France, and live where there will
come hardly an echo of all this strife to disturb
our blessed content and happiness!”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes from his and for a long
moment stood motionless while it seemed to her
that her very heart stood still. With swift inner
vision, like that of a drowning man, she saw those
years of wedded life, long years of comradeship
and love and deepest joy, with dear children growing
up beside them, and her heart yearned toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
its peace and happiness with such urgency that
she dared not try to speak.</p>

<p>“Think, Rhoda, dear,” he was pleading, “think
of the quiet, blissful years that are waiting for us!
Our two hearts together, and nothing, nothing
at all to come between them!”</p>

<p>Her very lips were pale with desire of it as she
whispered: “I am thinking, and, oh, Jeff, the
thought of it, the joy of it, almost makes my heart
stop beating. But have you thought, dear, dear
Jeff, what a sacrifice this will be for you? I know
how much you love the South. Would you never
regret it, never wish to come back and throw yourself
into her service? If that should happen, it
would be the end of happiness for us both, for I
should know it—our hearts would be so close
together—even if you didn’t say a word. Have
you thought of that, dear Jeff?”</p>

<p>He smiled at her with loving confidence. “I’ve
thought that all out, dear heart. For weeks I’ve
been thinking of it, and threshing it all out in my
mind, until I feel quite sure of myself. I do love
my dear Southland and as you know so well my
ambition has always been to spend my life in her
service. But there are plenty of other men who
can do her work as well as I can, and not at the
cost of their heart’s love and life’s happiness. I
am willing to let them do it while I take my love
and my happiness. My sweet! I knew your
dear, generous heart would ask me that!” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
bowed over her hand, which he still held in his,
and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>Her heart was pleading: “He is right. There
are plenty of others who can do his work, and
there are surely many, many who can do what
little is possible for me better than I. Why not
put it all aside and take the love and happiness
that belong to us?” And then, like an icy grip
upon her softening, yielding heart came remembrance
of the Thing that was about to happen in
the Virginia mountains.</p>

<p>She drew her hand from his and in sudden dismay
walked apart a few paces, saying, “Let me
think for a minute, Jeff!” She dropped her riding
skirt, whose fulness she had been carrying
over one arm, and its long black folds swept around
her slender figure as she leaned against a tree with
her face in her hands. So tall and straight and
slim she looked, drooping against the tree trunk,
that the fancy crossed his mind she was like some
forsaken, grieving wood nymph, and all his body
ached with the longing to enfold her in his arms
and comfort whatever pain was in her heart. But
his love as well as his courtesy forbade him to intrude
upon her while she stood apart, and he
waited for her to turn to him again.</p>

<p>Rhoda was thinking of what she knew was
about to happen and of what it would mean to
him. Her father had said that it would be like
the sudden ringing of an alarm bell and that, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
this initial attempt turned out, it might cause
the whole South to take up arms at once and declare
war. She knew how her lover’s spirit would
leap at such an emergency. Did she wish to put
his love and his promise to such a test at the very
beginning? Slowly she walked back and stood
in front of him.</p>

<p>“Jeff, this is truly a wonderful proof of your
love that you have given me!” Her voice was
tremulous with desire of all she felt she was putting
away, but she went bravely on: “I don’t believe
any other woman ever had such proof! Indeed,”
and she smiled tenderly at him, “I don’t
believe any other woman was ever loved quite so
much. It makes me feel your love in my heart,
oh, so much more precious than even it was before!
But I want you to be quite sure, dear Jeff!”</p>

<p>“I am sure, sweetheart!” he broke in.</p>

<p>“But won’t you wait a little while, two weeks,
no, three weeks, before I—we decide? I ask you
to go home, at once, and not to see me or write
to me for three weeks more. And then you can
let me know whether or not you still wish to put
your ideals and ambitions aside for the sake of
love. But I want you to consider the question
then just exactly as if we had never talked of it
before. You are not to feel yourself in the least
bound by what you have told me to-day. If anything
should happen between now and then that
makes you feel that the South still has a claim upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
you, anything that would make you in the very
least unwilling to—to carry out this plan, then I
want you to tell me so frankly—with perfect frankness,
dear Jeff, as perfect as our love.”</p>

<p>“And is that all the hope you will give me,
dearest?” he pleaded. “No promise to take back
with me?”</p>

<p>She was standing beside the path, on the rising
ground a little above him, and she leaned toward
him, resting her hands lightly upon his shoulders
as she said, her face all tenderness:</p>

<p>“Dear Jeff, it is for your sake I am asking it!”</p>

<p>He seemed scarcely to hear what she said, and
touched her cheek with a caressing palm as he
exclaimed, “Rhoda, my sweet, your face is like a
guardian angel’s!”</p>

<p>Before Jefferson Delavan reached Fairmount
again the Thing had happened that made the
North gasp with wonder and set the South beside
itself with fear and rage. The amazing audacity
of John Brown’s attack upon Harper’s Ferry
and the rankling distrust between the two sections
make reasonable, to impartial eyes of a later day,
the alarming significance which the southern people,
especially those in the border states, saw in
Brown’s foredoomed enterprise. The slaveholders
of Kentucky were aroused to almost as extreme
a pitch of angry apprehension and defiance as were
the people of Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>Rhoda Ware had not to wait even three weeks
for the expected letter from Jefferson Delavan.</p>

<p>“You were right,” he wrote. “You saw the
obstacles that lie between us more clearly than I
did—or, perhaps, you had more information than
I of the treacherous lengths to which the North
would dare to go in the desire to overthrow the
ordinary rights of a state and to undermine the
power of the government under which both sections
have solemnly sworn to live. This attempt
to incite the slaves to insurrection and the butchery
of their masters proves to all of us that neither
property nor life is safe in the South. At any
moment another plot may break forth, no man can
tell where, and be more successful than this one
was. The South needs now, more than she ever
did before, every one of her sons whom she can
trust. I cannot desert her in her hour of peril.
From the bottom of my heart I thank you, Rhoda,
that you made it possible for me to remain, without
dishonor, in the position where every instinct
of duty and honor and loyalty demands that I
stay. It was like you to know that, much as I
love you, love would have to yield to honor if it
came to a test between the two, and it has made
me love you all the more, if that were possible, to
know that your love is so rich and noble and generous.</p>

<p>“God knows what the future may hold for us
two. For the first time since our love began I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
can see no hope for us. The feeling between the
North and the South grows intolerable and the
bonds between them cannot last much longer. As
long as the South and her interests are in danger,
my conscience, my sense of duty, my loyalty, all
my ideals and aspirations, bid me stay here. And
here I know you will not come.</p>

<p>“But whatever happens, dear, I shall always
thank God that I have had the privilege of knowing
and loving you, while the knowledge that you,
such a peerless woman as you, have loved me will
be as long as I live the most precious treasure of
my heart. I have many dear memories of our
love, but the dearest of them all is of that last day
we had together, that splendid ride, when you
were so adorable, and of all the sweet pictures of
you that I cherish the sweetest of all is of your
face as you leaned toward me in the wood and
said, ‘It is for your sake, dear Jeff.’</p>

<p>“Only God knows whether or not we shall ever
see each other again. But I shall always love
you, and as long as we both live I shall treasure
in my heart the belief that you still love me.
Good-by, dear heart.”</p>

<p>“At last, it is all over,” Rhoda said to herself
when she had read the letter. “He sees, at last,
as I did so long ago, that there is no hope for us.
No—he sees none, now, but I can a little. John
Brown has brought the war ten years nearer,
father says, and any time it may come. And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
war will end slavery. But it’s best not to hope
too much.”</p>

<p>She took out the box of his letters and read
them all over again, touching them tenderly and
kissing the withered rose. “I’d better burn them
all now,” she told herself, “and try not to think so
much about it after this.”</p>

<p>With such pain in her heart as might have been
in Abraham’s when he led Isaac to the altar, she
carried her little love treasure to the fire. But
even as she held it poised over the flames her resolution
failed her. It was too much a part of herself
and she could not do it. The little box was
put away again in its hiding place and in the
months that followed, whenever the ache in her
breast would not be hushed in any other way, she
solaced her love and longing by reading the letters
over and over again, until she almost knew them,
word for word.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p>A year and a half and more went by before
Rhoda again saw Delavan. The campaign of
1860, with its grim earnestness and sober exaltation,
had passed. She had been stirred by it to
her heart’s core, as had all men and women of
the North, and had shared her father’s satisfaction
over the result. Hers was indeed an even
deeper and gladder satisfaction than his, for to
passionate abhorrence of slavery and the belief
that now was the beginning of its end was added
her secret small hope that afterward might come
the fulfilment of her long denied love.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t forget, Rhoda,” her father said
as they talked over the results of the election, “that
probably only a rather small percentage of those
who voted for Lincoln want to have slavery abolished
in the states where it already exists. They
really think the national government has no right
to interfere. But if there is war, and undoubtedly
there will be, a man of Lincoln’s shrewd common-sense
will know that by freeing the slaves he will
cut off the South’s right hand. With such a man
as he is in the president’s chair I feel confident,
though a good many abolitionists don’t, that we
can look forward to the end of slavery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>The southern states were leaving the Union and
the Confederacy had been organized. Rhoda
knew that Kentucky was rent almost to her every
hearthstone with discussion of whether North or
South should have her loyalty. Charlotte had
lately written: “Everybody is all torn into strips
over the question whether or not Kentucky shall
join the Confederacy. Nobody talks or thinks
or dreams of anything else. But Lloyd and I are
going to secede, whether Kentucky does or not.”</p>

<p>Now and then, at long intervals, had come a
brief letter from Jefferson Delavan. But he said
nothing in any of these missives of love and but
little of the mighty questions that were absorbing
the minds and hearts and souls of men, women and
children, North and South, and her replies were
of the same sort. It was as if two loving but far
divided souls, journeying through space, sought
now and then by a faint call to bridge the distance
between them.</p>

<p>The tense, dark days of Lincoln’s inauguration
were over, the guns of Sumter had cleared away
the last clouds of uncertainty, and war was at hand.</p>

<p>The lilacs were in bloom again and Rhoda,
moving slowly down the path, broke off here and
there a branch and presently stood at the front
gate, her fragrant burden gathered loosely into
one arm against her white dress. In her delight
in their delicate beauty and savor she bent her
face to the flowers, forgetting for the moment the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
things of the outside world. When she lifted it
again Jefferson Delavan stood before her.</p>

<p>“I have come to say good-by, Rhoda,” was his
greeting, as he entered the gate.</p>

<p>“Good-by?— You are—going—” she stammered.</p>

<p>“I am going to join the fortunes of the South,”
he replied, as they walked up the path. “Kentucky
has been false to her sister states and deserted
them when they need her most. By a single vote
she has decided upon neutrality. You, Rhoda,
can understand what a bitter dose that is for me.”</p>

<p>“You can’t endure it?” she hesitated as they
turned into the walk to the grape arbor.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, and there are many other Kentuckians
who feel as I do. I am going at once
to join the southern army, and Corey and Morehead
and a dozen others that I know are going
too.”</p>

<p>“Father has joined the Union army as a surgeon
and I am going as a nurse.”</p>

<p>They had reached the arbor and stood facing
each other, she with her armful of lilacs still held
against her white dress, both too much absorbed
to be quite conscious of their actions. A sober
smile curved by ever so little the grim line of his
lips.</p>

<p>“Then you will be fighting for your side as well
as I for mine, though in a different way. But
across the battlefields, Rhoda, I shall hear your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
heart calling mine, and I shall know too that it is
telling me to fight right on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she broke out earnestly, “I know that
you are fighting for your convictions and your
ideals and you will not be worthy of my love if
you don’t fight until you either win or are conquered.
I don’t want you to compromise, or to
yield, until you have fought to the last drop of
your strength.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a bitter struggle and a long
one, whatever the most of them, on both sides,
think now. In the South there isn’t much belief
that the North will fight, or can fight. But I
know better, Rhoda. You have taught me better,
you and your father. You have made me understand
what determination there is at the bottom of
all this.”</p>

<p>“It’s a war between two ideals,” she said, “whatever
else they may say it is. But it’s really that,
between two ideals of civilization.”</p>

<p>“And men,” he added quickly, “always fight
for their ideals as they do for nothing else. It
will be to the last gasp.”</p>

<p>She looked away and shuddered. “Oh, it is all
so horrible, even to think of! But it is a long
and horrible iniquity that has caused it and must
now be paid for. Rachel Benedict told me once
that we must ourselves pay with sweat and stripes
for the evil that we do. I believe it’s true, and
the North and the South must pay together for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
all this long evil of slavery, for they are both
responsible. But this war will end it.”</p>

<p>He smiled upon her indulgently. “Can you
think so, Rhoda, you, who understand how we
feel and how determined we are?”</p>

<p>She stepped back and proudly lifted her head.
Into her face came the look of exaltation he had
seen there, in this same arbor, long before. It
seemed to remove her far from him, and therefore
set his heart to throbbing all the more with
longing for her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “this war will end it, because
God is on our side. And afterward—oh, Jeff!”—her
face melted to tenderness again—“beyond—after
the end, after God has spoken and slavery
has been ended, then there will be peace, and for
us—” her voice dropped low—“happiness!”</p>

<p>“God be the judge between us, Rhoda Ware,”
he exclaimed, “as to which is right! Will you
accept His judgment, as He speaks it in battle,
and promise to be my wife when the war is over,
whatever He has said?”</p>

<p>Again her face was lifted, glowing with exaltation.
“God will never allow such an atonement
for evil-doing as this war will be,” she said
solemnly, “to be crowned by that very evil itself.
With faith in Him—I promise!”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words left her tongue when
she found herself swept to his breast and his lips
upon her brow, her eyes, her mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>“Rhoda, my love, my love,” he whispered,
“it is a long good-by that lies before us, perhaps
even as long as it has been since I first begged for
your love, here among these vines.”</p>

<p>“And there are battles and dangers, oh, so
many,” she whispered back, “between now and—the
end.”</p>

<p>“But I have a talisman that will carry me safe
through it all, to the end—and you. See, my
sweet, how long I have kept it!” From an inner
pocket he took a little package and showed her a
withered rose, the mate of the one she herself so
treasured. “I have kept it there, next to my
heart, ever since the night you gave it me, for my
thoughts, five years ago!”</p>

<p>She looked at it with wondering love, pressed
it to her lips and listened with a sweet smile upon
them as he said, putting it back again: “It shall
lie there always, dear heart, until all my thoughts
are yours and yours are mine. And it will always
tell me, as plainly as if with your own dear lips, to
fight to the uttermost!”</p>

<p>Again she lifted her head proudly. “Yes, to
the uttermost, Jeff! For that way only can your
eyes be opened!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was gone, and she sat alone in the arbor,
with her lilacs pressed to her bosom, and listened
as the strains of martial music came to her ears.
It was a band playing, downtown, where volunteers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
were being drilled. She could hear the
tramp of feet, the rattle of musketry, and the
words of command.</p>

<p>Louder and louder the sound seemed to grow
in her ears until it became the booming of unnumbered
cannon and the tramp, tramp, tramp of
a million men. The smoke of battle dimmed her
eyes and all around her she seemed to hear the
cries and groans of mangled and dying men.
With white lips she whispered to herself, “With
bloody sweat and stripes we must pay—it is God’s
law!”</p>

<p>Slowly her features relaxed, and presently, with
a tender smile curving her lips, she buried her face
in the lilac blooms. For the awful sights and
sounds had faded away and she had seen a vision
of the afterward.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
